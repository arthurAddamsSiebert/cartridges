     * ServiceLineItem is a LineItem to representing service costs with a LineItemCtnr, such as  such as shipping or handling. They are taxable and discountable.
     * 
     * <P>Generally a LineItemCtnr has just one ServiceLineItem (representing shipping costs), but the addition of ServiceLineItems representing another service or a credit voucher is conveivable and will be automatically included within the calculation process.
     * 
     * <P>A LineItemCtnr may have multiple ServiceLineItems, each one needs to be identified by a unique constant name, such as ServiceLineItemConstants.SHIPPING. A 'Shipping' ServiceLineItem is automatically added to the LineItemCtnr upon its creation. LineItemCtnr provides the following methods for accessing ServiceLineItems:
     * <br>createServiceLineItemsIterator - returns all ServiceLineItems
     * <br>findInServiceLineItemsByName(String) - returns ServiceLineItem with given name.
     * 
     * <P>Price summary (generally PC is Purchase Currency, LC Lead Currency, Base means before discount)
     * <BR>BasePricePC - cost calculated for shipping before applying a discount (note this price may be net or gross of tax, see price notes)
     * <BR>NetPricePC - price net of tax (= BasePricePC after applying discount when isBasedOnNetPrice is true, see price notes)
     * <BR>TaxPC - tax (calculated from PricePC or GrossPricePC depending upon  isBasedOnNetPrice flag, see price notes)
     * <BR>GrossPricePC - price gross of tax (= BasePricePC after applying discount when isBasedOnNetPrice is false, see price notes)
     * <BR>NetPriceLC - NetPricePC converted to LC
     * <BR>TaxLC - TaxPC converted to LC
     * <BR>GrossPriceLC - GrossPricePC converted to LC
     * 
     * <P>Price notes:
     * <BR>A service line-item is taxable and references a TaxClass which is used to calculate its decimal TaxRate (e.g. 17.5% = 0.175).
     * <BR>The BasePricePC may be gross or net of tax (method isBasedOnNetPrice), this flag is used in the tax calculation process.
     * <BR>The BasePricePC may be fixed (method isBasePriceFixed), meaning the designated price should not be overwritten by another pricing system.
