components of Intershop Commerce Management.","The information is designed to provide a rough overview of Intershop Commerce Management, with each topic addressed in more detail in subsequent sections.","Main Goals","Intershop Commerce Management is designed to:","Allow organizations to sell goods and services over the Internet to their direct customers with personalized storefronts and customer-specific catalogs","Provide commercial services to distributors or agents which do not have e-commerce capability of their own initiative","Easily integrate with the sell-side and/or ERP systems of customers and partners","Actors","Intershop Commerce Management can be used by different types of organizations.","Each type of organization participates in different business tasks and uses Intershop Commerce Management through a different set of business applications.","Main actors working on Intershop Commerce Management include:","Sales Organization","The sales organization represents the owner or root organization of a system that implements a multi-channel sales business model.","Typically, the sales organization represents an organization which manages its demand chain, publishes content and manages orders.","Sales Organizations use Intershop Commerce Management to:","Manage the internal structure of the sales organization, such as departments, users, and roles.","Create and manage channels for partners and customers.","Manage catalogs and publish them through sales channels.","Sell goods and services to customers.","Receive orders that can be fulfilled directly or exported to external systems.","Partners","Partners represent selling organizations working within a partner channel.","Hence, partners always have a superordinate or parent organization.","The parent organization can be the sales organization, or another partner higher up in the demand chain.","Partners use Intershop Commerce Management to:","Manage the internal structure of the sales organization, such as departments, users, and roles.","Syndicate products from the parent organization.","Create and manage channels for partners and customers.","Manage catalogs and publish them through sales channels.","Sell goods and services to customers.","Receive orders that can be fulfilled directly or exported to external systems.","Customers","Customers represent the individual or corporate buyers of a sales or partner organization.","Customers use the sales channel of Intershop Commerce Management to:","Browse catalogs made available to them.","Create and manage baskets/requisitions.","Create orders.","Participate in online marketing campaigns.","Central Administrators","Intershop Commerce Management includes a business application to perform central administration tasks, such as creating sales organizations, managing security settings, and initiating data replication processes.","Note:","Central administrators are also responsible for managing central system resources, such as pipelines and templates, locales, system-wide settings for payment, tax and shipping methods.","Many of these tasks are performed outside the business applications and require access to properties files and other system resources.","Channels and Applications Channels","Sales and partner organizations set up channels to syndicate products to partners, to sell to customers, and to receive orders.","Intershop Commerce Management pre-defines certain channel types.","The pre-defined channel types include:","partner channel","sales channel","The channel type defines","the business processes (including the front end applications) a partner or customer can use","the administrative tools available to manage the sales channel.","For example, the sales channel provides the storefront (the front end application) that customers use to browse catalogs and create orders.","In addition, the channel provides administrative tools (the channel management Commerce Management plug-in) used to manage the sales channel and the corresponding data, such as catalogs designed for customers or orders generated by customers.","Figure 1: Administrative tools for sales channels Figure 2: Sales channel front end application Applications","Intershop Commerce Management can run multiple applications in the context of a channel or site.","An application is a self-contained functional unit, based on an application type.","Typically, each application type defines an individual set of functionality in order to support dedicated business processes (like for B2C or B2B) or serve dedicated front ends (for example, mobile devices).","The applications of one channel may share the channel data repositories or may use their own, application-specific data repositories.","That is, an application can share, for example, the product data, user data and order data with the channel, but use its own content assets.","The effective repository relations depend on the underlying application implementation.","One application must be set as default, which means that it will be launched as the site's standard application if the URL does not include another application's URL identifier.","Applications provide a &quot;preview&quot; mode.","Originally a content management tool (see Storefront Design View), the application preview constitutes a powerful means to immediately preview the effect of certain actions triggered in Commerce Management directly on the Web site, including promotion settings, price changes, etc.","For details about applications, see Application Management: Concepts.","Demand Chains","Based on the channel concept, the Intershop Commerce Management enables sales and partner organizations to create demand chains which are tailored precisely to their business needs.","Figure 3: Creating demand chains.","Besides channels, demand chains are based on two essential features: product syndication and sharing as well as order processing.","Product Syndication and Product Sharing","Intershop Commerce Management provides two mechanisms for distributing products across channels: product sharing and product syndication.","Product Sharing","With product sharing, sales or partner organizations can distribute large numbers of master products to sales channels.","The products are not copied to the target channels but remain in the parent organization's master repository.","Product Syndication","With product syndication, sales channels can derive master products from parent sales or partner organizations.","The master products are actually copied to the channel repositories.","Each organization can set up a master repository for products.","Via product sharing or syndication processes, products can flow down the demand chain: from the master repositories to the channel repositories, then to the master and channel repositories of partner organizations, from there to the repositories of an indirect reseller, and so on.","For more details about the two product distribution mechanisms, see Product Sharing vs.","Product Syndication.","Order Processing","Complementary to the product distribution processes, which distribute products down the demand chain, orders generated inside channels are forwarded (one level) up the demand chain.","That is,","orders can be fulfilled directly in the channel,","or orders (or individual order line items) can be processed by the sales organization that operates the channel.","Via the order export functionality, orders can be prepared for being processed by other organizations or external systems.","Basic Concepts","./con_basic.html","13,5","7 Jan 2019");

dimensions:","Standard and Classification Catalogs","Standard catalogs use a freely-defined category structure to group products.","Classification catalogs, on the other hand, pre-define the set of catalog categories to which products can be assigned.","Apart from defining the set of available categories, they can also define classification attributes.","Classification attributes are automatically associated with products assigned to a certain catalog category.","Intershop Commerce Management provides out-of-the-box support for classification catalogs based on the eCl@ss and UN/SPSC standards.","These catalogs are pre-loaded by the central administrator.","They can be set online or offline by catalog managers of sales organizations.","However, they cannot be deleted.","In addition, catalog managers can define custom classification catalogs.","Shared and Local Catalogs","Catalogs can be shared or local.","Shared catalogs are master catalogs which are shared to one or more channels.","These catalogs can then be accessed by the business partners using that channel.","Catalog sharing makes it possible to use pre-defined catalog structures across different channels.","System Classification Catalogs","System classification catalogs are a means for creating and grouping products that have specific properties and therefore require a different handling.","This may be the case with products like warranties, gift wraps, or downloads, which, for example, may be excluded from search indexes, may not require an inventory, etc.","Table 6: Predefined system classification attributes","Attribute Description","ExcludeFromSearchIndex Prevents all products of this category from being included in the search index.","ExcludeFromShipping Prevents all products of this category from being included in the shipping calculation.","HasNoInventory Prevents all products of this category from being subject to inventory calculation, that is, the products are always available (e.g., downloads).","IsNotOrderable Prevents all products of this category from being ordered individually, that is, the products can be ordered only in combination with other products (e.g., warranties).","System classification catalogs are created with the database initialization only and cannot be edited via Commerce Management.","Business managers can just assign products to the prepared system classification categories.","The products then &quot;inherit&quot; all properties defined for the particular categories, becoming usable warranties, gift wraps, or downloads, for example.","Classification Attributes","For categories of custom classification catalogs, classification attributes can be defined in order to pre-define the attributes of the products assigned to a category.","When assigning a product to a classification category with classification attributes defined, the attributes are offered to the product manager in a list.","Note, however, that the product manager needs to set attribute values before the attributes are actually copied onto the product.","If copied onto a product, the attributes become available via the Attributes tab which is part of the product detail view.","Basic Product Features","The following list summarizes basic product features:","General Product Information","Each product contains a name and a unique product ID for identification purposes within the system.","Product Attributes","There are two attribute types: standard attributes and custom attributes.","Standard attributes apply to all products.","Custom attributes can be used to define attributes specific to a certain product.","Product attributes can be localized.","Localizable attributes define attribute values relative to a locale (or language).","Note:","Localizable attribute names are defined using the product attribute group mechanism.","For details, see Product Attribute Groups.","Tip:","If, e.g., a product has no localized value for a custom attribute, the respective locale will not hold a search field for this attribute.","This means searching for an empty field (&lt;&lt;none&gt;&gt;) will not work in such case, since the field does not exist at all.","For details about search options, see General Search Options.","Category Assignments","A product can be assigned to multiple catalog categories.","Using advanced search, you can find all products currently assigned or not assigned to a catalog category.","In addition, each product can be assigned to standard classification catalogs (such as eCl@ss or UN/SPSC) or custom classification catalogs.","Attachments","Additional product-related content, such as product specifications, user manuals, and brochures or info sheets can be linked to each product for the buyers to view.","Before attachments can be added, the respective content need to be uploaded into a content directory, which can then be browsed when defining attachments.","For information on creating content directories and uploading static content, see Catalog Import and Export.","Catalog Views","By default, all product catalogs defined or available within a channel are visible to all customers of this channel.","Catalog views allow the channel catalog administrator to control the visibility of product catalog content on a customer-specific or customer segment-specific level.","Using catalogs views makes it possible to personalize product catalogs depending on the individual needs of customers or customer segments, or even to hide entire product catalogs from selected customers or customer segments.","Setting up a catalog view involves the steps as shown in the following figure:","Figure 14: Catalog Views: General Workflow","Include and Exclude Categories or Products","Defining a catalog view involves explicitly including or excluding product catalog categories or products.","When starting catalog view definition, the catalog view excludes all categories by default.","Your task then is to add all catalog categories that are to be included.","To view only parts of a category branch, first include the main catalog category, then exclude the sub-categories or products that should be hidden.","Assign Customers/Customer Segments to View","Assign customers or a customer segment of the current channel to the catalog view.","Once assigned, the view is effective for all members of the target group.","Note that a single customer or customer segment can be assigned to multiple catalog views in parallel.","If a customer or customer segment is not assigned to any view, there are no catalog visibility restrictions.","You can assign catalog views to customers or customer segments also when editing customer or customer segment details.","Set View Online and Publish View","For a catalog view to be applied, it needs to be set online first.","Later on, catalog views must be published whenever new categories are included or excluded or whenever the product repository is updated.","It is possible to have catalog views published at regular intervals using a scheduled job to automate this process.","The page cache is invalidated automatically as soon as a catalog view is set online or published.","Note:","In case catalog view definitions are in conflict, the settings for including categories take precedence over settings for excluding categories.","For example, assume that a customer segment is assigned to two catalog views, A and B.","Catalog view A includes the category &quot;Monitors&quot; while catalog view B excludes this category.","In this case, the category in question will be visible to the customer segment assigned to these catalog views.","Inbound Product Sharing","With product sharing, sales or partner organizations can distribute large numbers of master products to sales channels (&quot;outbound product sharing&quot;).","The products are not copied to the target channels but remain in the parent organization's master repository.","Generally, all deriving channels share the master data, regardless of their hierarchy.","Channels can, however, choose to activate all or only a selected set of the shared master products (&quot;inbound product sharing&quot;).","For details about managing inbound product sharing, see Managing Inbound Product Sharing.","Predefined Product Filters","With an integrated third-party search engine (see Search Index Services), Intershop Commerce Management features flexible product filtering options.","Catalog managers can predefine product filters.","Predefined product filters are then available for dynamically assigning products to catalog categories, or for automatically populating page components with products, intended to be displayed, for example, as category page &quot;end caps&quot;.","Predefined product filters apply either directly to a catalog/category (see Assigning Products Using Filters) or through assigning specific, product filter-aware pages, see Managing Category Content Views.","For details about managing product filters, see Managing Product Filters.","Product Status","Product status refers to the attributes online/offline and availability.","Products can be set online or offline.","A product set offline is not visible in the storefront any longer.","The product status can be set to apply always, from a future point in time onwards, or during a limited time interval.","Product status definitions can be used via advanced search.","Availability indicates whether a product is in stock or not.","Product status attributes can be used as advanced search parameters.","Note:","Both attributes are checked before an order is created.","If a product has turned offline or is not available anymore after having been added to a basket or requisition, it cannot be ordered.","In product list views, the product status is illustrated using the icons explained in the following table.","Table 7: Product status icons in product list views","Icon Description","Indicates that the product is online.","Indicates that the product is offline.","Indicates that the product is unlocked, i.e., it is currently not edited.","Indicates that the product is locked for the current user, i.e., it is currently edited by the current user.","Indicates that the product is locked for another user, i.e., it is currently edited by another user.","Indicates that the product is in stock.","Indicates that the product is offered, i.e., syndicated to a channel, see Product Syndication.","Indicates that the product is explicitly bound into a catalog category.","Indicates that the product is implicitly bound into a catalog category.","In master product repositories, indicates that the product is shared to a channel.","In channel product repositories, indicates that the product is shared from a master repository.","In channel product repositories, indicates that the product is shared from a master repository and modified in the channel.","Indicates that the product is linked to other products (e.g., as replacement).","Product Lifecycle","Two special attributes are available to manage the product lifecycle.","The last order date defines the latest point in time at which a product can be ordered.","The product remains visible in the storefront, but cannot be added to the basket anymore.","The end-of-life date has the same effect.","It can be used for additional purposes, e.g.","to indicate when support for a product expires.","Note that the end-of-life date (if defined) has to follow the last order date.","Product lifecycle definitions can be used as advanced search parameters.","Tip:","Product bundles (see Product Bundles and Retail Sets) and product variation masters (see Product Variations and Product Variation Types) can inherit the last order date and the end-of-life date from the bundled products or variation products they contain.","When using the inheritance mechanism, last order date/end-of-life date of the product bundle or variation master is automatically set to the earliest last order date/end-of-life date set for one of the contained products.","Alternatively, the last order date/end-of-life date can be set manually for product bundles or variation masters.","Product Approval","In some cases, merchants may want to review and explicitly approve product information when it meets the quality requirements.","To this end, Intershop Commerce Management facilitates an optional product approval process.","With respect to product approval, the following details are essential:","The product approval can be enabled/disabled on channel level.","With the product approval disabled, the approval status information and the manual approval functionality are hidden.","The approval status does not affect the visibility of products in the storefront.","There are three approval statuses: &quot;Edit&quot;, &quot;In Review&quot; and &quot;Approved&quot;.","Table 8: Approval statuses","Status Description","Edit The product is being (or is waiting to be) edited.","In Review The product data is complete and ready to be reviewed.","Approved The product is reviewed.","With the product approval enabled, two access privileges come into play: product approver and catalog &amp; product manager.","Table 9: Product approval-related access privileges","Access Privilege Product Approval Responsibility","Product approver Product approvers are responsible for managing and approving the product data.","They can set the following approval statuses: from &quot;In Review&quot; to &quot;Approved&quot; or &quot;Edit&quot;, as well as from &quot;Approved&quot; to &quot;Edit&quot;.","Catalog &amp; Product manager Catalog &amp; product managers are responsible for editing the product information (&quot;data enrichment&quot;).","They can set the approval status from &quot;Edit&quot; to &quot;In Review&quot; and vice versa, but they do not have the right to approve product data nor to set approved products back to editing.","Basically, this allows for the following approach:","The two actors (depending on the current approval status) can request product data modifications in case they identify missing or incorrect data.","Catalog &amp; product managers then edit the data accordingly and request approval.","Product approvers review and approve the data.","Note:","Creating or importing new products after the product approval has already been enabled requires updating the corresponding database records.","To this end, Intershop Commerce Management provides the pre-configured job &quot;General Product Approval&quot;.","Ask the system administrator of your Intershop Commerce Management system to schedule or run this job.","For details about product approval settings, see Enabling Product Approval.","For details about the product approval procedure, see Managing Product Approvals.","SEO Meta Tag Attributes","Product pages and catalog pages of sales channels include specific title and meta tags that optimize Intershop Commerce Management-based storefront pages for Internet search engines.","The title and meta tag information (page title, meta description) is stored as attributes with products, catalogs and categories.","Commerce Management managers can access these SEO attributes via the attribute tabs of product, catalog and category detail dialogs.","For details, see Managing SEO Attributes for Product Pages and Managing SEO Attributes for Catalog and Category Pages.","Information for the following page header tags is supported:","page title","meta description","The header information to be inserted can be:","generated automatically,","generated automatically with additional prefix/suffix, or","edited manually.","Note:","SEO attributes are completely localizable.","The rules for the automatic tag data creation differ while the context changes.","That is, depending on the object concerned (catalog/category or product), different tag content is generated.","The default tag content is outlined below:","Table 10: Automatically generated header tag content","Object Tag Contents","Catalog/Category Page title: category name, parent category, category title suffix","Description: category name, subcategories, category special","Product Page title: product name, category, product title suffix","Description: product name, short description Note:","The tag content will be truncated after 256 characters.","The category title suffix, category special and product title suffix are configurable text strings stored in global or site-specific properties files, located in (&lt;IS.INSTANCE.SHARE&gt;/system/config/cluster/seo) or (&lt;IS.INSTANCE.SHARE&gt;/sites/&lt;site&gt;/&lt;ID&gt;/units/&lt;channel_unit&gt;/seo), respectively.","The title or meta tag information, which is generated or edited in the search engine attribute dialog in Commerce Management, is saved to the storefront's ApplicationFrame template and then rendered into the resulting HTML page.","Figure 15: SEO attributes in the Commerce Management dialog","SEO meta tags in the resulting HTML source","&lt;html lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; &lt;head&gt; &lt;meta name=&quot;robots&quot;

special prices for Computers&quot; /&gt; ...","&lt;/head&gt;","If required, Intershop Commerce Management can add specific noindex and nofollow tags to storefront pages.","These tags prevent search engine robots from indexing pages and from following links on them, respectively.","These tags can be set for product pages and category pages as part of catalog/product management, and for page variants as part of content management.","Be aware that selecting this option for page variants overrides any settings made for products or categories.","Product Attribute Groups","Standard and custom attributes of a product can be assigned to product attribute groups.","Product attribute groups provide a powerful mechanism to impose a meta-structure on large and complex sets of attributes.","Product attribute groups can be used for various purposes, including:","Managing attribute mapping rules in synchronization processes","Attribute mapping rules for synchronization processes can be based on attribute groups.","If an attribute group is selected, all attributes that are part of this group are copied 1:1.","Providing localizable attribute names","When defining the attributes that should belong to an attribute group, you provide an attribute name and an ID.","The attribute name is used for display purposes.","The ID is matched by the system against standard and product attributes in order to retrieve the respective attribute value.","If the attribute values are localized as well, the value for the respective locale is retrieved.","For example, if the current locale of a user is German (de_DE), the system retrieves the attribute name for German as defined in the attribute group, and the attribute value for German as defined on the product to be displayed.","Product Image Management","As part of the store setup, a sales or partner organization configures the product images that will be available for the possibly multiple product views in the storefront, like, for example, catalog list view, detail view or cart view.","Image management comprises the following main tasks:","Uploading physical images","Physical image files intended to be used as product images must be uploaded to the Intershop Commerce Management system.","Prior to actually importing files, it is possible to create a dedicated directory structure to store and manage the uploaded content.","Managing image views","An image view defines the perspective or the context in which the product is shown on the image.","Each of these views may be available in several dimensions as defined by the image type.","Organizations can define a primary image view, which is used as default if at product level no other image view is set as primary.","Managing image types","An image type is used to typecast the individual physical images that are available for a specific image view.","The type can distinguish between various image sizes (e.g., zoom, standard, thumbnail), quality scales (e.g., low, medium, high_externally_hosted) or MIME types (e.g., gif, png, tiff).","In addition to the primary image view (or predefined image sets, if any), catalog managers can associate extra image view/type combinations to products, thus making them available for use on product detail pages, for example.","Managing image sets","Image Sets are a means to combine image views and image types.","These combinations can then easily be applied to product classifications or used by accordingly set up content components.","For details how to manage images, see Managing Product Images.","Product Pricing and Price Lists","Intershop Commerce Management features powerful, yet flexible mechanisms to define product prices, including list prices, cost prices, and price lists containing customer-specific scaled prices.","List Price and Cost Price","Each product has a list price.","The list price is a simple, fixed price independent from the ordered product quantity.","A list price can be defined separately for each currency available on the system.","The list price serves as main reference for calculating other product prices, such as scaled prices within price lists.","Optionally, a cost price can be defined for a product, again separately for each available currency on the system.","Sales and partner organizations can use this price to represent the cost which arises when procuring the product from a supplier or parent organization.","Using the cost price as a basis, various scenarios are possible in which the list price of a product is derived from its cost price by adding a fixed or percentage surcharge, or by granting a discount.","For example, the list price of a product could be the cost price plus 10% on top, representing the desired margin.","Figure 16: Product with list and cost price defined","List price and cost price can be managed in two different ways: using the Pricing tab of the product detail view, or using the Price List manager.","Two price lists are available by default: the Standard Price List, which lists all products along with their defined list price, and the Cost Price List, which lists all products for which cost prices have been defined.","These lists provide direct access to product prices, facilitating the management of list and cost prices for products.","Figure 17: Price lists for managing list and cost prices Note:","Product prices are stored in the database with a precision of two places following the decimal point.","It is possible to define a higher precision, e.g.","with three places to the right of the decimal point.","Contact Intershop Support to get help on this issue.","Mapping List and Cost Prices in Syndication","When deriving products via syndication, various options are available for mapping and re-calculating list and cost prices.","Which options are available depends on whether the syndication process involves repositories belonging to different organizations (e.g., when syndicating from a channel repository of organization X to the master repository of a partner organization Y), or whether syndication involves repositories belonging to the same organization (i.e., when syndicating from the master repository to a channel repository).","The mapping rules below are available in case products are syndicated from a repository that belongs to a different organization.","For example, the rules are available if the sales organization syndicates products from a supplier into its master repository, or if a partner organization syndicates products from its parent organization.","Copy list price","This rule copies the list price from the source to the derived product.","Optionally, the list price can be modified by adding a fixed or percentage surcharge, or by granting a fixed or percentage discount.","Convert price to different currency","This rule copies the list price from the source to the derived product and converts it into a different currency, using the exchange rates centrally defined for the system by the system administrator.","Optionally, the list price can be modified by adding a fixed or percentage surcharge, or by granting a fixed or percentage discount.","Use list price as cost price","This rule copies the list price of the source product as cost price of the derived product.","Note that with this rule, the derived product does not receive a list price.","Use list price as cost price and convert to different currency","This rule copies the list price of the source product as cost price of the derived product and converts it to a different currency, using the exchange rates centrally defined for the system by the system administrator.","When a channel repository syndicates products from its master repository (hence, when syndication does not involve different organizations), additional mapping options are available which enable cost-plus based pricing:","Calculate list price from cost price","This rule calculates the list price of the derived product on the basis of the cost price of the source product.","The cost price can be taken as-is, or can be modified by adding a fixed or percentage surcharge, or by granting a fixed or percentage discount.","Calculate list price from cost price and convert to different currency","This rule calculates the list price of the derived product on the basis of the cost price of the source product and converts it into a different currency, using the exchange rates centrally defined for the system by the system administrator.","The cost price can be copied as-is, or can be modified by adding a fixed or percentage surcharge, or by granting a fixed or percentage discount.","Special Price Lists and Scaled Prices","In addition to list prices, channel administrators can define special price lists for channel products.","Special price lists are used for the following main purposes:","Define Scaled Prices","The prices contained in price lists are expressed as scaled prices.","A scaled price can vary depending on the order quantity.","The scaled price can be expressed as fixed price (e.g., 12,99 USD) or as percentage discount (e.g., 10 %).","For each active currency, a separate scaled price for each ordered quantity can be defined.","Define Customer-Specific Prices","Price lists can be used to define special prices targeted at specific customers or customer segments.","As part of setting up price lists, you can define to which target group, i.e., customers or customer segments, the price list applies.","Hence, the prices that a price list defines are valid only for those users that are member of the target group assigned to the price list.","You can assign price lists to customers or customer segments also when editing customer or customer segment details.","Define Time-Limited Prices","For each price list, channel administrators can define a valid-from and valid-to date.","Hence, price lists can be used to define special prices valid during a limited period of time.","For example, the sample product below defines two different prices for the price lists &quot;Best-Price Offerings&quot; and &quot;Christmas Thank-You Promotion&quot;.","The price defined for price list &quot;Christmas Thank-You Promotion&quot; is customer-specific, as this price list is available to member of customer segment &quot;Premium Customers&quot; only.","Figure 18: Sample product with prices for different price lists","Two price lists are available by default: the Standard Price List, which lists all products along with their defined list price, and the Cost Price List, which lists all products for which cost prices have been defined.","These lists provide direct access to product prices, facilitating the management of list and cost prices for products.","Note that if a user is part of multiple customer segments, situations may arise in which more than one price could be offered to this customer.","To resolve conflicts like this, Intershop Commerce Management offers two price lookup strategies:","If multiple price lists are defined for a channel, the channel administrator defines a ranking for these price lists.","According to the &quot;Custom Lookup&quot; strategy, the system checks all available price lists top-down, starting with the price list ranked highest, until a price could be determined.","According to the &quot;Best Price&quot; strategy, the system will select the best price from all price lists which can be applied to the current user, regardless of the price list ranking.","Figure 19: Lookup strategies for multiple prices Note:","Scaled prices and price lists cannot be syndicated across repositories.","Price List Replication","In data replication environments, catalog managers can publish price lists from the editing system to the target system on fine-grained base.","To this end, they first publish the intended price list to the target system.","Afterwards, they individually select the prices to be replicated and publish them.","For details, see Publishing Price Lists.","Net/Gross Prices","Generally, different business scenarios may require prices to be displayed either as net prices or as gross prices.","Depending on the type of prices (net or gross) stored with the product data, some calculations may apply in order to display the prices correctly according to the intended business model, that is, either without the sales tax or including the sales tax.","To this end, Intershop Commerce Management features a powerful price/tax calculation mechanism as well as flexible configuration options.","Note:","The settings mentioned here and, consequently, the corresponding calculations affect product prices (incl.","warranties and gift wrapping), shipping costs, surcharges and payment costs as well as promotion-based discounts.","With respect to determining net/gross prices, the following details are important:","Price type","Specifies the type of prices (net or gross) as stored in the data repository.","Must be set as part of the pricing preferences, see Managing Pricing Settings.","Price display","Specifies, individually for each customer type, whether the storefront prices shown to this customer type are net prices or gross prices.","Must be set as part of the pricing preferences, see Managing Pricing Settings.","Tax calculation service","Calculates the possible difference between the given price type (net or gross) and the selected price display preference (net or gross), and propagates the applicable taxation data to any following process.","Intershop Commerce Management provides two standard services (Product VAT Exclusive Taxation and Product VAT Inclusive Taxation) that determine the net price or the gross price as required for display purposes, see Managing Tax Calculation Services.","Other tax calculation services (custom or third-party) can be implemented on a project-specific base.","Tax class","Product-specific setting that defines which tax class applies and must be used by the tax calculation service.","Can be set as part of the product pricing, see Managing Product List Prices and Cost Prices.","The default tax classes are &quot;FullTax&quot;, &quot;ReducedTax&quot; and &quot;NoTax&quot;.","The available tax classes can be set up by the central administrator.","Be aware that when calculating net prices or gross prices, Intershop Commerce Management uses other taxation data like tax jurisdictions, tax classes, tax rates etc., which are defined by the system administrator.","For detailed information about configuring taxation data, system administrators can refer to Guide - Locales, Tax Data, Currencies and Exchange Rates.","The following table outlines the possible scenarios with respect to price type and price display, and indicates the (default) tax calculation service to be applied accordingly.","Table 11: Price/tax calculation scenarios","Price type Price display Service","A net net Product VAT Exclusive Taxation","B net gross Product VAT Exclusive Taxation","C gross net Product VAT Inclusive Taxation","D gross gross Product VAT Inclusive Taxation Note:","Make sure to always enable the appropriate tax calculation service according to the price type, even if it is not necessary for calculating the display prices (scenarios A and D above).","In addition to actually determining the net prices or gross prices, these services also facilitate other taxation data (tax jurisdictions, tax rates, etc.) to any following process.","Product and Sub-Category Sorting","Generally, there are different ways to control the display order in which products or sub-categories of a catalog category are displayed in the storefront.","Sorting based on predefined product filters","Sorting based on specific sorting attributes","Manual sorting","Sorting With Product Filters","If you dynamically populate catalog categories with products using predefined product filters (see Predefined Product Filters), you typically use these filters for sorting purposes, too.","Predefined product filters apply either directly to a catalog/category (see Assigning Products Using Filters) or through assigning specific, product filter-aware pages, see Managing Category Content Views.","Tip:","Using predefined product filters requires a search index controlled by a third-party search engine, see Search Index Services.","The default filter, which is applied to all categories via the default Category Page unless you define otherwise, defines Sort by price (ascending) as sorting criterion.","In case your product filters do not define criteria for product sorting or category sorting, you can control the sorting order at multiple levels using attributes as described in Sorting With Attributes.","Note:","Sorting settings based on predefined product filters always overrule any other channel-specific, catalog/category-specific or manual sorting settings.","Sorting With Attributes","You can manually add products to catalog categories (see Assigning Products), which does not require predefined product filters.","In this case, you can control the display order for products and sub-categories using product/category attributes declared as sorting attributes.","The standard sorting attributes include Product Name, Product ID, List Price and Manufacturer Name.","In addition, any custom attribute can be selected.","If a sorting attribute has been defined, products and sub-categories are sorted in ascending or descending order, depending on their attribute value.","In case not all products or categories have the attribute defined which determines the sorting, list elements without a value for the sorting attribute follow on list elements that can be sorted.","Sorting preferences can be defined at three levels:","General Sorting Preference","For both product and category sorting, it is possible to declare a sorting attribute as a channel preference that serves as fallback or default across all catalogs, see Managing Sorting Preferences.","This channel default can be overwritten at catalog level or category level by declaring a sorting attribute for the entire catalog or a specific catalog category as shown below.","Catalog-Specific Sorting","For each catalog, sorting attributes for products and categories can be declared.","This sorting definition is then applied to all categories and products of the catalog.","The catalog-specific sorting attribute overwrites the general channel sorting preference.","For details, see Managing Sorting Attribute.","Category-Specific Sorting","For each category, a sorting attribute can be declared in order to control sorting at category level.","The category-specific sorting attribute overwrites the both the definition at catalog level and the general preference.","For details, see Managing Sorting Attribute.","Note:","Sorting attributes declared at category-level apply only to products at this particular level.","They are not inherited by sub-categories.","Using sorting attributes does not depend on a search index controlled by a third-party search engine, see Search Index Services.","If you do use a search index for product searches in the storefront, you must update the search index after you have modified a sorting setting in order to have the changes displayed.","Note that the search index must include the selected sorting attribute.","For example, if you intend to sort products by Color (= custom attribute) within a category, the attribute Color must be &quot;indexed&quot; and set &quot;sortable&quot;, see Managing Search Indexes.","Manual Sorting","In addition to automatic sorting using sorting attributes, catalog categories and products can also be sorted manually.","For details, see Manual Sorting.","Note:","Manual sorting overrules the sorting preferences based on sorting attributes, see Sorting With Attributes.","Manual sorting does not depend on a search index controlled by a third-party search engine, see Search Index Services.","If you do use a search index for product searches in the storefront, you must update the search index after you have modified a sorting setting in order to have the changes displayed.","Note that the search index must be assigned the attribute Category Position.","This attribute adds the position of the product in a category (manual sorting of products in the category) to the search index.","Warranties and Gift Options","In Intershop Commerce Management, warranties, gift wraps and gift messages constitute special products with specific properties like, for example, not individually shippable or no inventory.","Warranties, gift wraps and gift messages are grouped in dedicated system classification categories, which propagate the corresponding properties to these products when establishing the assignment relation.","Note:","System classification categories are created with the database initialization only and cannot be edited via Commerce Management, see Catalog Types.","As warranties are intended to be sold in combination with &quot;real&quot; products only, they feature specific pricing options, as outlined below.","Table 12: Warranty pricing","Option Description","Fixed Price Used to define a fixed amount to be charged as the warranty price.","Percentage The warranty price depends on the product price.","It is calculated as a percentage amount based on the list price of the product to which the warranty is applied.","Scaled Prices The warranty price depends on the product price.","This price type uses &quot;brackets&quot; to define value ranges to which specific warranty prices apply.","Product List Price: Product list price up to which the current warranty price applies.","Warranty Price: Amount that applies to the current product list price.","Note:","The tax for a warranty will be calculated based on the product to which the warranty is applied.","Product Variations and Product Variation Types","A product variation represents a product that is offered in multiple different variants.","The offered variants share most of their attribute values, but are different at some of their attributes.","For instance, a computer may vary on the attributes &quot;Processor Speed&quot; and &quot;Hard Disk Size&quot;.","Each product variant can have a specific product SKU, price or other attributes, such as images and specifications.","Product variations consist of","A variation master","Multiple variation products","Tip:","Starting with Intershop Commerce Management 7.9 Product Master Pages, which previously only displayed a default product, may now work as a family page displaying the variation products as a filterable list.","This feature also affects the representation of the master product in a product list / category list.","For basic information on how to achieve this, refer to Product Master Detail Page.","Variation master and variation products are standard products in the sense that each of them can have standard and custom attributes, prices, attachments, etc.","Note also that the attribute values of the variation master and the attributes of the variation products are not related to each other.","Product variations are based on a variation model.","The variation model defines","The variation attribute","This is the attribute which variation master and variation products have in common.","Possible attribute values","Product variations can be defined with reference to existing products in a repository by first defining the variation model on the product that acts as variation master, and then selecting the variation products from the repository.","It is also possible to have the variation products created automatically, based on product variation types.","A product variation type pre-defines a variation attribute and possible attribute values.","When creating variation products based on a variation type, a new variation product is created for each resulting attribute-value pair in the variation type.","For example, when defining a variation type with an attribute &quot;Processor Speed&quot; that has two possible values (say, &quot;3 GHz&quot; and &quot;3.4 GHz&quot;), two variation products will be created.","The attributes of the variation master","These attributes are set to the same value as they have in the variation master.","The SKU is set to an artificial SKU arbitrarily derived from the SKU of the variation master.","The variation attribute defined in the variation type","For each possible attribute value, a different variation product is defined.","It is also possible to automatically create variation products based on more than one variation type at the same time.","For example, when creating variation products based on variation_type_A (with attributes &quot;Processor Speed&quot; and &quot;3 GHz&quot; and &quot;3.4 GHz&quot; as possible values) and variation_type_B (with attribute &quot;Hard Disk Size&quot; and &quot;120 GB&quot; and &quot;200 GB&quot; as possible values), four variation products are created: two products with value &quot;3 GHz&quot; for &quot;Processor Speed&quot; and &quot;120 GB&quot; or &quot;200 GB&quot; as respective values for &quot;Hard Disk Size&quot;, and two products with value &quot;3.4 GHz&quot; for &quot;Processor Speed&quot; and &quot;120 GB&quot; or &quot;200 GB&quot; as respective values for &quot;Hard Disk Size&quot;.","For more detailed information on product variations refer to Concept - Product Variations.","For more information on how to manage variation products refer to Managing Variation Products.","Product Bundles and Retail Sets","A product bundle represents a group of products that is offered to customers with an own SKU and an overall price.","The bundle is typically designed to be ordered as a whole and presented in the storefront as a single item.","The products that are part of the bundle (referred to as bundled products) can be product bundles themselves.","Product bundles can be imported and exported like standard products.","A retail set is similar to a product bundle.","A retail set combines products to be presented together on the same storefront page, as a group of products.","Typically, all products can be added to the basket with a single click.","Unlike product bundles, however, retail sets do not have an overall price.","Hence, when ordering all products belonging to a retail set, the overall price is calculated from the prices of the individual retail set products.","The products that are part of a retail set can be retail sets themselves.","Retail sets can be imported or exported like standard products.","Category Links and Product Links","Catalog managers can define static links between products and/or catalog categories in order to define relations between products and categories.","The following link relations are possible:","product - product","product - category","category - product","category - category","When working with catalog categories or products, catalog managers can define both &quot;outbound&quot; links and &quot;inbound&quot; links.","Outbound links define another product or category as the &quot;relation target&quot;, whereas inbound links make the current category the &quot;relation target&quot; of another product or category.","These links can be of different types, depending on the business semantics of the link.","Intershop Commerce Management provides out-of-the-box support for the link types listed below:","Table 13: Product Link Types","Link Type Description","Replacement To offer similar products to buyers.","Replacement products can be shown when the requested product is currently out of stock.","Cross-Selling To offer related products.","In the storefront, cross-selling products can be shown, for example, on the basket page, based on the products the buyer has currently in the basket.","Up-Selling To offer alternative products, e.g., similar products offered at a different price.","In the storefront, up-selling products can be shown, for example, on the product detail page under the heading &quot;Other User's Choice&quot;.","Accessory To offer complementary products, such as a monitor for a desktop computer.","In the storefront, accessories can be shown, for example, on the product detail page under the heading &quot;Accessories&quot;.","Follow-Up To offer follow-up versions of the product currently selected.","In the storefront, follow-up products can be shown, for example, on the product detail page under the heading &quot;Newer Versions&quot;.","Different Order Unit Refers to offer(s) of the same product sold in a different order unit.","In the storefront, different order unit products can be shown, for example, on the product detail page under the heading &quot;Also available as&quot;.","Spare Parts To offer available spare parts for a product.","In the storefront, spare parts are included on the product detail page as links to the respective product detail pages.","Gift Wrap To offer available &quot;gift wrap&quot; products for a product.","Gift Message To offer available &quot;gift message&quot; products for a product.","Warranty Creates a warranty relation between the current product and a &quot;warranty&quot; product.","Other This link type does not have a pre-defined semantics and is currently not used in the reference storefronts.","Table 14: Category Link Types","Link Type Description","Cross-Selling To offer related products.","In the storefront, cross-selling

pages.","Other This link type does not have a pre-defined semantics and is currently not used in the reference storefronts.","Product Assignment","&quot;Product assignment&quot; refers to the (logical) allocation of a product to a catalog category.","Via product assigment, products become part of a catalog.","Product assignment can be done either manually or dynamically:","Manual assignment","Manual assignment means that the category-product associations are created explicitly when editing a product or a category.","Dynamic assignment","Dynamic assignment makes it possible to automate the category-product associations on the basis of product filters, see Predefined Product Filters.","Note:","Product filters require an integrated third-party search engine, see Search Index Services.","For details about manual product assignments, see Managing Products Within Catalog Categories.","For details about dynamic product assignments, see Assigning Products Using Filters.","Product Search","Products can be searched by a simple search, an advanced search or a classification search.","Simple search","The simple search mask allows you to search for a product using a single keyword.","It searches the product name and ID in each catalog for the matching keyword.","Advanced search","Using the advanced search, you can increase the accuracy of your searches by specifying the exact search criteria.","For example, you can search for a specific product name, product ID, manufacturer name or price range.","Classification search","The classification search is a &quot;special case&quot; advanced search.","It is primarily intended to perform searches using specific classification attributes as search criteria, see Classification Attributes.","For an overview of common search options, see General Search Options.","Note:","For certain tasks that are typically applied to multiple products (e.g.","updating custom attributes or deleting products), it is possible to process all products of the result set in batch mode.","Product History","All changes within a product repository are logged by the system and can be viewed in a product history.","The product history is used to:","log changes in the repository you are currently working in (master or channel repository)","log changes in a syndication source directory","This can be the master repository of the current organization or a repository of the parent organization.","For details about possible sources for syndication, see Product Syndication.","Changes are tracked when a product is modified","in Commerce Management","during product syndication and synchronization processes","during product batch processes","The product history provides information about added products, updated products, and deleted products.","For updated products, update details are provided, such as changed attributes (including old and new attribute values), added or deleted attributes, changes to attachments, product links, content relations, product variations, or product bundles.","Each product history entry includes the user and the modification date.","Preferences can be set to activate the product history feature and to configure how long changes are preserved in the product history.","The product history can be filtered by various criteria, such as user or date.","Recycle Bin","The recycle bin is a container to temporarily keep products after they have been deleted from a repository.","Products kept in the recycle bin can be restored, preserving all attributes including category assignments, assignments to product bundles, and assignment to variation masters.","The behavior of the recycle bin, hence the behavior of the product deletion process, is controlled by recycle bin preferences.","The recycle bin preferences are set in the master catalog area of sales or partner organizations offer the following possibilities:","Recycle Bin Disabled","If the recycle bin has been disabled, products are deleted permanently from the product list view.","Deletion is not propagated.","Therefore, products in other repository which have been derived from the current product via syndication are not affected.","Recycle Bin Enabled, Propagation of Deletion","If you opt for propagating the deletion, not only the current product is moved to the recycle bin, but also all products derived from the current product in other repositories.","Hence they are no longer visible in the storefront.","Recycle Bin Enabled, Without Propagation of Deletion","If you opt against propagating the deletion to derived products, the syndication relation to the current product is deleted but the derived products are retained.","Note:","In case you want to restore a product which has been derived from another product via syndication, make sure this product is contained in the source repository.","You cannot restore a product derived from a product which is currently in the recycle bin as well.","In this case, restore the source product first.","When deleting a product which is a variation master, the associated variation products are not deleted as well.","Likewise, deleting a product bundle does not delete the products which are part of this bundle.","Product Rating","Customers can rate each product offered in the storefront and write online reviews to share their thoughts with other users.","If a product has been rated, the average rating is displayed.","Administrators can view the individual ratings and comments for each product in Commerce Management.","Ratings and comments can be deleted in Commerce Management to avoid abuse of this feature.","Notification Agent","The notification agent can be used by registered customers to receive an e-mail in case","the price of a product has dropped to a certain value","a product which is currently out-of-stock is available again.","In Commerce Management, you can specify in which intervals the agent should check whether notification mails need to be sent out.","Product Sharing vs.","Product Syndication","Intershop Commerce Management provides two mechanisms for distributing products across channels: product sharing and product syndication.","Caution:","Product sharing and product syndication cannot be used in parallel in the same channel.","If sharing is enabled for a channel, products cannot be syndicated to this channel.","If, in turn, products are syndicated to a channel, products cannot be shared with this channel.","Product Sharing","With product sharing, sales or partner organizations can distribute large numbers of master products to sales channels (&quot;outbound product sharing&quot;).","The products are not copied to the target channels but remain in the parent organization's master repository.","Generally, all deriving channels share the master data, regardless of their hierarchy.","Channels can, however, choose to activate all or only a selected set of the shared master products (&quot;inbound product sharing&quot;).","Channels that share master products can still add new products or change attributes of a master product by overriding the entire product.","When changing a master product attribute, a new channel product is created with a reference to the master product (which serves as a look-up fallback).","Note, however, that shared product variations, bundles and retail sets cannot be modified.","For details, see Product Sharing Management: Concepts.","Note:","Intershop recommends to use product sharing for distributing large numbers of products, assuming only little changes to the data in the channels.","Product Syndication","With product syndication, sales channels can derive master products from parent sales or partner organizations.","In a mass data operation, the master products are actually copied to the channel repositories.","Product syndication requires the mapping of attributes (standard product attributes, catalog assignments, prices, etc.) of the original source product into attributes of a target product (offer).","Specific rules control how attributes of the original (source) product are mapped into attributes of the target product.","Upon syndicating, hence, attributes can be changed.","For details, see Product Syndication.","Note:","Intershop recommends to use product syndication for distributing products across channels if the product data is expected to be changed in the channels.","Which product distribution mechanism to apply depends on the intended business scenario, with particular respect to the number of products and their attributes, the channel structure, the expected channel-specific data changes, etc.","In the context of a sizing estimation, for example, Intershop can evaluate this question and, consequently, recommend either sharing or syndication.","Catalog Import and Export","Intershop Commerce Management features powerful import mechanisms to facilitate mass data handling.","Important concepts related to import and export processes are outlined in the following sections.","To learn about import formats available, both XSD Schema files and ASCII import files are available.","If necessary, contact your system administrator to obtain these files.","What Can Be Imported or Exported?","The following entities can be imported or exported:","Static Content","Static content includes, but is not restricted to, product images, data sheets, and user manuals.","These files can be referenced, for example, when defining images or attachments for a product.","It is possible to create a directory structure to store and manage uploaded content.","Note that the content of zip files is automatically extracted and stored in the designated directory.","Adobe Scene7 Images","Scene7 dynamic content can be imported in ASCII format (from CSV files).","Product Data","Product data can be imported into the master or the channel repositories.","The data is imported in ASCII format (csv files using the semicolon as separator) or XML format.","Product data can be exported in XML format.","Catalog Categories","Catalog categories can be imported for master and channel catalogs.","Catalogs are imported using data sources in ASCII format (csv files using the semicolon as separator) or XML files.","To import a category structure,

are not written to the database.","Can be used for testing purposes.","IGNORE Ignores all objects that already exist in the database, creates records only for new objects and adds them to the database.","For example, if a product is specified in the import source and the product is found in the database by the import/export service, it is not modified.","UPDATE Updates existing objects and creates records for new objects.","Attributes and objects that do not exist in the import file are kept untouched.","REPLACE Replaces existing objects (UUID is kept) and creates records for new objects.","Objects that do not exist in the import file are kept untouched.","Missing attributes of existing objects (in the import file) will be removed.","DELETE Deletes all import file records that exist in the database.","INITIAL Does not perform a database query to find existing objects.","This allows for a quick import but causes an error whenever an object is imported that already exists.","This mode is generally used during the DBInit process.","Object Locking","Concurrent mass data operations and individually triggered &quot;single-object&quot; operations may produce inconsistent data.","Intershop Commerce Management features a specific object-locking mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications of the same data.","In case a user intends to edit an object that is already locked by another process, Commerce Management shows a warning and, depending on the operation, provides options to either","steal the lock, where the &quot;calling&quot; process takes priority and can run,","wait a specified time and then fail, where the &quot;calling&quot; process waits the defined time for the previous lock to be released in order to run afterwards, or fails if the timeout is reached.","fail, where the &quot;calling&quot; process is terminated immediately.","Product Identifiers","For successful import of product, catalog and other data, certain elements must be defined in the data source while others can be optional.","When preparing the import data, always check the Intershop XSD schema files for optional and required elements.","If necessary, contact your system administrator to obtain these files.","For product import, note that Intershop Commerce Management uses an extended product identifier system (PIDs), in addition to standard product SKUs.","Intershop Commerce Management supports the following product identifier types:","Manufacturer ID","This product identifier is defined and maintained by the original manufacturer of a product.","Since manufacturers are not hosted by Intershop Commerce Management, they do not manage these IDs within the Intershop Commerce Management database themselves.","However, these identifiers are important whenever hosted suppliers or sellers need to interact with their manufacturers, for example to fulfill orders.","Supplier ID","This product identifier is defined and maintained by the supplier of a product.","Suppliers usually aggregate products from different manufacturers and therefore need their own numbering schema to uniquely identify products from different manufacturers.","Seller ID","This product identifier is defined and maintained by the actual seller of a product.","Seller IDs are defined relative to a product identifier scope.","This makes it possible to assign multiple seller IDs in case the seller offers the product in multiple repositories.","Buyer ID","This product identifier is defined and maintained by a buying organization.","PIDs are defined as custom attributes.","Each PID definition comprises two parts: one part to define the owner of the PID (buyer, seller, supplier, or manufacturer), the other part to define the actual value.","A sample definition of a Supplier ID is shown below:","&lt;custom-attribute dt:dt=&quot;string&quot; name=&quot;PID_OWNER_SupplierID@global&quot;&gt;IQ&lt;/ custom-attribute&gt; &lt;custom-attribute dt:dt=&quot;string&quot; name=&quot;PID_VALUE_SupplierID@global&quot;&gt;D598 9C&lt;/custom-attribute&gt;","In many cases, PID definitions are more complex.","Consider the sample below.","The sample defines three different PIDs (SellerID, SupplierID, ManufacturerID).","Note that the Seller ID has a well-defined scope (the domain &quot;inSPIRED-MasterRepository&quot;) to identify the repository relative to which the Seller ID has been defined.","&lt;custom-attribute dt:dt=&quot;string&quot; name=&quot;PID_OWNER_SellerID

D5989C&lt;/custom-attribute&gt;","When preparing products for import, take care of the following issues:","A product to be imported by a supplier must have at least a PID of type SupplierID.","A product to be imported by a selling or buying organization must have at least a PID of type SellerID or SupplierID.","When defining a SellerID, a scope must be provided which references the domain behind the repository to which the SellerID belongs.","Contact your system administrator to obtain the domain names to use.","Make sure the structure of the PID is correct.","PIDs with incorrect structure are ignored during import.","Moreover, the system ignores a PID definition with value &quot;null&quot; or no value at all.","Note:","PIDs are validated automatically before import.","General

similar purposes as - export processes.","In fact, they rely on the same internal operations.","However, product data feeds go beyond standard product export with respect to the following features:","Export to different XML formats","Product data feeds allow you to determine the formatting of XML data in the resulting export file.","By default, product data feeds support exports to Intershop XML, Sitemap XML, Feed Dynamix Feed and Product RSS Feed.","For details, see Product Data Feed Targets.","Data transformation before export","Similar to the product syndication process, product data feeds support attribute mapping.","This enables you to modify data structures as required, e.g., by changing attribute names or transforming attribute values.","The mechanism can also be used to control which attributes are to be exported, and which are not.","Scheduled exports","Product data feeds can be triggered manually in Commerce Management, or via an automated job at regular intervals.","Product Data Feed to an Intershop Commerce Management Target System","In cases like this, the product data feed is used to selectively transfer product data (database content and related file system content, including images, thumbnails and attachments) from a source to a target system, similar to data replication.","In fact, the product data feed - if used to transfer product data to a target system - relies on the same environment as data replication in terms of architecture, setup and configuration of the source and target system.","However, the underlying mechanisms to actually transfer data are entirely different.","With product data transfer using the product data feed, data objects are converted to WebObjects and serialized by Apache Axis.","A Web service residing at the target system is then used to deserialize the WebObjects and merge the data into the target system's database.","Note:","In contrast to data replication, the product data feed is designed to transfer small sets of data, for example individual products that have been modified on the source system, with the changes having to be transfered immediately to the target system.","When using the product data feed to transfer product data to a target system, the following specific issues are important:","System Environment","Before the product data feed to a target system can be used, the system administrator has to set up source and target system and prepare them for data transfer.","The steps are identical to the steps necessary to prepare the source and target system for data

the object type.","Note:","Depending on the type and the configuration of the Intershop Commerce Management system and the amount of data to be changed, a bulk operation (e.g., batch processes, import and export processes, audit reports) may cause negative effects on the system performance or the data consistency.","Contact your Intershop Commerce Management system administrator before triggering a bulk operation.","For details about performing batch processes, see Editing Objects in Batch Mode.","Mass Data Operations Using Labels","Labels provide a convenient means to group objects, in order to perform certain operations on these objects.","Objects to which labels can be assigned include products, catalogs and categories as well as page variants, components and other content assets.","Labels facilitate the execution of recurring operations, or operations that need to be applied to a large set of objects.","For example, using labels you add or update custom attributes on objects, or export a set of objects.","Note that using labels is similar to editing objects in batch mode, see Batch Processes.","However, labels provide more flexibility, as they make it possible to group objects together that cannot be identified by a single search query.","Moreover, label assignments are persistent, hence can be re-used as often as necessary.","Working with labels involves the following tasks:","Defining labels","The first step is to create labels.","A dedicated Label manager is available to create and manage labels, and to view all items which currently have this label assigned.","Figure 55: Label detail view","Assigning labels to objects","Once labels have been created, they can be assigned to objects.","To assign labels to individual products, catalogs or categories, use the Labels tab on the detail view of the respective object.","For products, you can also perform a search and apply a label to all elements of the result set using a batch process.","Triggering actions to be performed on labeled objects","For labels that have been assigned to one or more objects, you can use the Label manager to select actions to be performed on these objects.","Figure 56: Selecting actions in the Label manager","For details about working with labels, see Label Management.","Data Replication What Is Data Replication?","Data replication refers to the process of first updating data in a source system and then synchronizing the data with a target system.","The data replication mechanism makes it possible to develop and maintain content in the background without disturbances to the live system.","Data replication affects both database data (such as catalog, product, or user data) and file system data (such as images or product attachments).","Concurrent mass data operations and individually triggered &quot;single-object&quot; operations may produce inconsistent data.","Intershop Commerce Management features a specific object-locking mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications of the same data.","In case a user intends to edit an object that is already locked by another process, Commerce Management shows a warning and, depending on the operation, provides options to either","steal the lock, where the &quot;calling&quot; process takes priority and can run,","wait a specified time and then fail, where the &quot;calling&quot; process waits the defined time for the previous lock to be released in order to run afterwards, or fails if the timeout is reached.","fail, where the &quot;calling&quot; process is terminated immediately.","Data replication involves two main stages: defining data replication tasks and executing these tasks as data replication processes.","Both stages are described in more detail below.","Data Replication Tasks","Data replication tasks determine the content to be replicated.","They are defined by the responsible data replication managers individually for each channel in Commerce Management.","For example, the data replication manager for the channel &quot;inTRONICS&quot; can define data replication tasks for this particular channel, using the sales channel management Commerce Management plug-in.","For each data replication tasks, the data replication manager defines","Start Date","The start date sets the earliest time at which a replication task can be executed.","Replication Groups","To each replication task, one or more data replication groups are assigned.","Data replication groups identify the content to be replicated.","Each replication group refers to a certain content domain.","For example, the data replication group &quot;Organization&quot; includes the organization profile, the departments, the users and roles, and all preferences defined for an organization.","Figure 57: Data replication tasks","For details about data replication tasks, see Data Replication Task Management.","Data Replication Processes","Once defined, data replication tasks are submitted to the Intershop Commerce Management system administrator for execution.","To execute data replication tasks, the system administrator defines data replication processes in Organization Management.","For each data replication process, the system administrator defines:","Target System","A source system can be connected to multiple target systems.","However, each replication process can address a single target system (or a single target cluster) only.","Replication Tasks","Each replication process executes one or more replication tasks as submitted by the responsible data replication managers.","Only replication tasks whose start date has been reached can be included with a replication process.","Activation Rules","Data replication processes can be started manually, or as scheduled jobs at predefined times.","Data Replication Type","The data replication type determines whether a replication process involves only content transfer, content publication, or both.","Additional replication types are available for special tasks or to undo a replication process involving content publication.","Product Syndication","Intershop Commerce Management provides two mechanisms for distributing products across channels: product sharing and product syndication.","For a general introduction, see Product Sharing vs.","Product Syndication.","With product syndication, sales channels can derive master products from parent sales or partner organizations.","The master products are actually copied to the channel repositories.","Copied (or derived) products are sometimes called also &quot;offers&quot;.","Products are stored in product repositories.","Each sales or partner organization can set up a master product repository.","From the master repositories, products can be derived into the available channel repositories.","Channel repositories are defined in the context of a channel.","Each channel has a channel product repository.","The channel repository contains the products to be made available to customers or partners.","Using master and channel repositories, products can flow down the demand chain: from the sales organization to customers and sales partners, from the sales partners to indirect resellers, and so on.","Product syndication involves the following general workflow:","Define Attribute Mapping Rules","Product syndication requires the mapping of attributes (standard product attributes, catalog assignments, prices, etc.) of the original source product into attributes of a target product (offer).","Attribute mapping is governed by product data mapping rules.","Select Products for Syndication","Products can be derived in different ways and from different repositories, depending on whether you derive products into a master repository or a channel repository.","Manage Synchronization","Synchronization ensures that derived products remain synchronized with their sources in case the sources are updated.","For details about executing syndication processes, see Product Syndication and Synchronization.","Attribute Mapping Rules","Product syndication requires the mapping of attributes (standard product attributes, catalog assignments, prices, etc.) of the original source product into attributes of the derived product.","Figure 58: Attribute mapping rules","The simplest mapping operation is to copy the value of a source product attribute into the same attribute of the target product.","A more complex operation is to copy a source product attribute into a different attribute of the target product or, even more complex, to manipulate the attribute value before storing it into the target product, such as calculating a margin on a product price or translate the name of a product into another language.","Tip:","If no mapping rules are defined, the following attributes are copied automatically (via copy 1:1): seller ID, product image, product thumbnail, short description, and product price.","Different rule sets can be defined depending on the source repository from which products are derived.","Each rule set enables you to specify the following:","Table 66: Attribute mapping rules","Data Description","ID Defines whether product ID's for seller, supplier and manufacturer are copied, and if so, whether they are copied as-is, or with a prefix and/or suffix added.","Attributes Defines (for each attribute) whether the attribute is to be copied as-is, or to be mapped onto a different attribute.","Attributes for which no mapping rule is defined are not mapped at all.","Attribute Groups This option makes it possible to automatically synchronize all attributes that belong to a certain attribute group.","With this option, attribute values are always copied as-is.","Category Defines whether category assignments are preserved.","This option is only applicable in case products are syndicated from a master repository into a channel repository.","This option also presumes that the master catalogs to which the category assignments relate have been shared to the respective channel.","Classifications Defines whether assignments to classification systems (such as eCl@ss and UN/SPSC) are preserved.","This option is only applicable in case the classification system is available for the current repository as well.","Attachments Defines whether attachments to a product (such as data sheets) are preserved.","Attachments can be copied or be defined as link to the original data source.","Assignments Defines whether product bundle, retail set and variation assignments are preserved when syndication takes place.","Price Price can be copied as-is, or be mapped to a different currency using a certain exchange rate.","Note that for each target currency, only one rule can be defined.","In addition, you can define a surcharge or discount that applies when copying or mapping prices.","Links Defines whether settings for product links of the original data source are preserved.","Note that links to other products are preserved only in case the products in question have been syndicated as well.","Synchronization","Synchronization ensures that derived products remain synchronized with their source products in case the sources are updated.","You can define individually for each source repository whether synchronization should be triggered manually in Commerce Management, or via an automated job at regular intervals.","Synchronization can be set to","apply to all products in the source repository, regardless of whether source data have changed (Synchronize All).","This option is used, for example, in case product data mapping rules have changed, requiring a synchronization over the entire set of products.","apply to only those products in the source repository which have been modified.","This option is used to apply changes in the source repository to the syndicated products.","You can use the product history to track updated, changed or added products in accessible source repository.","In addition, differences between source and derived products are automatically tracked by the system.","The synchronization process runs as a batch process.","Updates are applied automatically.","Note:","Depending on the type and the configuration of the Intershop Commerce Management system and the amount of data to be changed, a bulk operation (e.g., batch processes, import and export processes, audit reports) may cause negative effects on the system performance or the data consistency.","Contact your Intershop Commerce Management system administrator before triggering a bulk operation.","Search Index Management","Intershop Commerce Management can integrate third-party search engines via dedicated adapter cartridges, see Managing Search Index Services.","Once implemented and enabled, the integrated search builds and queries specific index files located in the site's file system structure.","With an integrated search engine, the Mass Data section of Commerce Management integrates a dedicated Search Index manager.","Use this manager to enable, configure and build the search indexes, which then serve as the base for the intended advanced search options in the storefront.","For details about search index management, see Managing Search Indexes.","Audit Report Management","The Audit Report is a Commerce Management feature (under Mass Data section) that captures and generates event/object reports for activities in all management contexts (organization, channel and application).","Reports and logs of shop events (create, update and delete) are captured for every object providing a transparent view of shop activity.","By configuring the filters you can customize the criteria used to generate the report.","Generate a report based on user-initiated Commerce Management activity by means of the following functionality:","Search","Search for user activity by management context, User ID, object type, date range and transaction type.","Sort","Sort reports by User ID to see object activity undertaken by a particular user.","As well you can sort reports by data range, that is, return object activity in ascending or descending update date.","Object Results","Generate a report for a single object up to two years from the occurrence of the event.","For details about audit report generation, export etc., see Audit Report Management.","Localization","Channel managers can maintain the static texts to be displayed in the sales channel storefront on a channel-specific base and separately for each available locale.","The localization tool allows for searching and editing individual storefront texts.","In addition, you can import localized values and export existing texts for localization.","For details about the localization management, see Localization Management.","Mass Data Management:

generation.","The main tasks involved in managing online marketing activities are:","Managing Promotions and Promotional Codes","Promotions are one of the basic online marketing tools.","A promotion defines a discount and determines a target group to which the discount is made available.","Promotions can be based on coupons, which customers redeem by supplying the coupon code when placing an order.","Furthermore, promotions can be associated with content components via content relations.","For details, see Promotions and Campaigns.","Managing Gift Cards/Gift Certificates","Gift cards and gift certificates are products of a special type.","They can be bought by customers in the storefront either digitally (&quot;gift certificates&quot;) or physically (&quot;gift cards&quot;).","For details, see Gift Cards and Gift Certificates.","Managing A/B Tests","A/B tests provide a simple and powerful tool to test the effect that different promotions have on customer activity in the storefront.","For example, you may want to set up two identical promotions, then change a single parameter in one of them.","You can then use A/B testing to find out how the change affects customer behavior.","Do customers add more products to their baskets, or does the number of orders increase?","For details, see A/B Tests.","Managing Affiliate Partners","Users entering the sales channel storefront from an affiliate partner site are automatically assigned to a special customer segment.","The system can track the amount of orders and the revenue generated through an affiliate partner site.","For details, see Affiliate Partners.","Managing SEO Features","Intershop Commerce Management supports Rich Snippets, locale-specific links and, for catalog categories, &quot;rich content&quot; descriptions.","These techniques help web search engines to index your content better and to present it more prominently in search results.","For details, see Search Engine Optimization.","Intershop Commerce Management also integrates Google Tag Manager using a dedicated service.","For details, see Google Tag Manager.","Managing Online Marketing Services","Intershop Online Marketing offers additional services that help you to promote your e-commerce initiatives.","Intershop Commerce Management supports services like short links and redirect URLs, landing page evaluation and product data feed generation.","For details, see Short Links and Redirect URLs, Landing Pages and Product Data Feeds.","Promotions and Campaigns","Promotions are the main tool for your online marketing activities and can help you to draw customers to your site and increase sales.","Generally, promotions define some sort of discount or benefit and determine a target group to which the discount should be made available.","Note:","Defining a target group is optional.","If no target group is defined, the promotion does not apply to any customer.","You may furthermore restrict access to promotions by distributing promotional codes (in the form of coupons) amongst your target audience.","Customers then need to provide the promotional code in order to prove that they are entitled to the promotion.","Another feature of promotions is that they can be associated with content components via content relations.","Hence, promotions constitute an instrument for content personalization.","Creating promotions that specify only target groups and associated content components (i.e., promotions without discounts) enables shop operators to publish target group-specific content.","Campaigns provide a means to combine multiple promotions.","In addition, marketing managers can assign dedicated CMS page variants or components to campaigns as well as define specific target groups and validity periods for campaigns.","The following terms and concepts are essential with respect to promotion management:","General Promotion Details","General promotion details include the promotion name, an ID, a description, settings on how a promotion can be combined with other promotions, the activation period, and budget details.","Promotion Ranking","Since Intershop Commerce Management permits you to run multiple promotions at the same time, it may happen that several valid promotions apply to one basket.","To define the calculation order of the promotions, marketing administrators can define a rank for each promotion.","As a result, the promotion with the highest rank is calculated first.","Promotion Target Group","The target group of a promotion can be a special customer segment (e.g., all first-time shoppers, or all recurring customers) or customers individually selected from the pool of users registered with the channel.","Promotions can also be targeted at customers that are associated with affiliate partners or affiliate partner programs.","Note:","In order to be able to assign customer segments as a target group, at least one segmentation service must be configured for the sales channel, see Customer Segments.","Discount Rule, Promotion Condition, Promotion Discount","For each promotion you can define one or more discount rules.","Each discount rule itself defines one or more conditions and a discount.","Multiple conditions can be combined by logical operators AND and OR to form a single expression.","This expression evaluates to either True or False.","If the conditional part of the rule is True, then the promotion is applied and the customer will get the discount defined by the rule.","For example, you could create a discount rule that says trigger the promotion when the customer places at least five items in the basket or spends more than 100 USD on a single item from a specific product category.","If these conditions are met, apply a 10% financial discount.","Thus you can create very powerful discount rules allowing you to model even the most complex marketing strategy in a very flexible way.","Promotion Codes","Promotion Codes provide an additional means to propagate the promotion to the target group.","For example, promotion codes could be distributed amongst the target audience via newspaper, radio, or TV advertisements.","Customers who want to benefit from the promotion will need to enter the promotion code during the order checkout process.","Dynamic Basket Message","For each discount rule you can set up an individual dynamic message that will be displayed when the promotion has not been triggered yet but is close to being triggered.","Using this feature, you could for example display a message on the basket page saying &quot;Add 2 more items to your basket to receive free shipping!&quot;.","The threshold that triggers the displaying of the dynamic message is configurable for each promotion independently.","Promotion Messaging","Promotion messaging contains an icon and various texts that will appear in the context of promoted products, e.g., on catalog or product detail pages.","The default configuration is to display an icon, a short title and a long title component along with a details link on product details pages.","When the storefront user clicks the details link, an overlay pop-up opens comprising a long title, descriptive text, and legal disclaimer text.","Content Relations","You can set up content relations that associate the promotion with specific CMS-based page variants or components.","General Promotion Preferences","Promotion preferences that apply to all promotions in a given sales channel include promotion budget sources, promotion type priorities and the validity expiration behavior.","A budget source is like a tag you can use to categorize a promotion's budget.","You may, for example, define a budget source for promotions aimed at partners, and another one set up for employees.","Currently the budget source has no further effect on the promotion or its budget.","The promotion type priority specifies in which order various promotion types are to be applied when calculating discounts.","The priorities set for the sales channel can be overridden by promotion-specific settings.","The validity behavior setting specifies whether a promotion is still applicable for a running session even after the time or the budget has expired.","For details about setting general promotion preferences, see Managing Promotion Preferences.","Discount Rules Promotion Conditions","When defining discount rules you specify the conditions that trigger the promotion.","Triggering a promotion means, that the promotional benefit is applied to either a product in the customer's basket or the entire order.","In a discount rule, multiple conditions can be combined using the logical operators AND and OR to build complex Boolean expressions.","For example you may create an expression constructed from the following conditions:","the numbers of items in the basket is greater than 10","the order total is greater than 100 USD","the customer-selected shipping method is &quot;ship to store&quot;","Assuming that you combine all these conditions using AND operators, the promotion will be triggered when each of the sub-conditions is True.","If an expression contains both logical operators (AND and OR), the AND operator takes precedence over the OR operator.","For example, if you create an expression consisting of three conditions like this C1 AND C2 OR C3, the sub-expression C1 AND C2 is evaluated first and the result of the expression is afterwards OR-combined with C3.","The various conditions you can choose from fall into four categories, see the following table for details:","Table 31: Promotion Conditions","Category Condition Description","Activation Time Activation Time This condition allows you to schedule a promotion in a fine-granular way.","Define a time range during which the promotion is active by specifying a start and an end date.","Using the frequency options you can determine on which days during the activation period, the promotion will be active.","Thus you may configure a promotion to be only available on a certain week-day or on a certain day of the month.","By specifying an intraday period, you may define a daily start and an end time for the promotion.","Customer Profile customer's first purchase The condition triggers the promotion, when a new customer orders for the first time through the channel.","customer's first purchase per month Triggers the promotion, when the customer orders for the first time in the current month.","customer's first purchase since date Triggers the promotion, if the customer orders for the first time since the specified date.","Either select a date using the calendar widget, or enter a date by hand.","Item Item Inclusions/Exclusions Allows you to define a promotion exclusively for selected products and categories (inclusions) or to prevent the promotion from triggering for selected products and categories (exclusions).","Click the provided links and select items to include/exclude from the list of available objects.","Select the Override Store Level Exclusions checkbox if you want to override the default exclusions for the application set in the preferences, as described in Managing Promotion Preferences.","Minimum number of items defined in item inclusions Specify the minimum number of items defined in item inclusions a customer needs to place in the basket in order to trigger the promotion.","minimum price of items defined in item inclusions Specify the minimum price for an item defined in item inclusions a customer needs to place in the basket in order to trigger the promotion.","minimum total purchase amount of items defined in item inclusions Specify the minimum total purchase amount for all items defined in item inclusions a customer needs to place in the basket in order to trigger the promotion.","shipping method Allows you to define a set of shipping methods for single items that will trigger the promotion.","shipping region Allows you to define a set of shipping regions for single items that will trigger the promotion.","Order minimum number of items Triggers the promotion, if the items in the order reach the specified number.","minimum order value Triggers the promotion, if the order's total reaches the specified value.","payment method Allows you to define a set of payment methods for the order that will trigger the promotion.","shipping method Allows you to define a set of shipping methods for the order that will trigger the promotion.","shipping region Allows you to define a set of shipping regions for the order that will trigger the promotion.","Promotion Discounts","Promotion Discounts determine the benefit that the promotion offers to the members of the target group.","See the following table for details on the available discounts.","Table 32: Promotion Discounts","Type Trigger Description","Item item percentage off Grant a percentaged discount on a product.","item target price Grant a (modified) fixed price for a product.","item value off Grant a fixed discount on a product.","Order order percentage off Grant a percentaged discount on the order value.","order value off Grant a fixed discount on the order value.","Shipping shipping percentage off Grant a percentaged discount on the shipping cost.","shipping target price Grant a (modified) fixed cost for shipping.","shipping value off Grant a fixed discount on the shipping cost.","Free Gift automatic gift Grant a give-away product, placed free of charge in the customer's basket.","hidden gift A hidden gift is similar to a free gift but is added silently to the order and does not appear in the customer's basket.","Campaign/Promotion Publication","For campaigns and promotions to become effective, they must be enabled.","This applies to all campaigns and promotions, regardless of the conditions or discounts they define.","If you are working in a data replication environment, changes are made on a source (editing) system first and are transferred to a target (live) system automatically at regular intervals, usually during times of low server load, e.g., during the night.","However, you can also transfer the changes you made in a campaign or promotion manually by publishing the campaign or promotion.","Publishing a campaign or promotion will replicate all changes you made to it, including the following related objects:","Promotions assigned to a campaign","Promotion code groups/promotion codes assigned to a promotion","campaign/promotion messaging data, i.e., texts and associated graphics etc.","Assigned content assets (page variants, components) if their parent objects exist in the target system","Attached files.","Note that the publication will fail if you try to publish a campaign/promotion with an object assignment that would be invalid (because of a missing object) in the target system.","Note also that object deletions are not propagated to the target system, that is, if you delete an associated object in the source system, the object will remain in the target system after the publication.","For step-by-step instructions on publishing campaigns, see Publishing Campaigns .","For step-by-step instructions on publishing promotions, see Publishing Promotions.","Promotion Codes (Coupons)","Promotions can either just define a discount - they are available to all customers, or they can require the customer to enter a promotion code, which restricts them to customers in possession of the valid code.","It is up to the sales organization to propagate the codes to the promotion target group, be it individual users or user groups, in a way the organization considers appropriate.","Note that any user who is able to provide the code within the promotion's activation period and before the coupon's expiration date will benefit from the promotion.","There are two ways of assigning coupons to a promotion:","By defining a single coupon","Each customer uses the same code to redeem the coupon.","For details, see Enabling Promotion Codes for Promotions.","By defining promotion code groups","You can define as many coupon codes for the promotion as you need for the members of your target group.","Each customer will have its own unique code.","The codes can be created manually, generated automatically following a specific pattern for the code, or by importing them from an external source (CSV file).","Optionally, you can exclude ambiguous, potentially misleading characters from generated promotion codes.","For details, see Creating Promotion Code Groups.","Promotion Code Search","The promotion code search allows to search for promotion codes.","Business managers or customer service representatives may use this functionality to answer questions about the validity of promotions or promotion codes.","Furthermore, e-commerce managers can check the status of configured promotions or campaigns.","In the search results view, the following information is available:","Redemption Status","The value (x/y) indicates that the action code has already been redeemed x times for an available quantity of y.","Validity Status","A green validity status () indicates that at least one promotion is valid for this code at this time.","This applies for a possibly assigned campaign (or campaigns) as well.","A red validity status () indicates that no associated promotion or campaign is valid at this time.","Figure 47: Example: Promotion Code Search Result","The link given in the Promotion Code column opens the promotion code search detail view.","Note:","Customer-specific information is only available if a customer has been specified in the promotion code search, see Searching Promotion Codes.","In the promotion code search detail view, the following levels are shown on the left side:","Promotion Code","This level shows the validity status and redemption status for the current code and the current customer.","If the promotion code is enabled and not redeemed, a green icon is shown .","If the promotion code is disabled and/or redeemed, a red icon is shown .","Promotion Code Group","On this level, the assigned promotion code group with promotion code group name, status, activation date range and assigned application(s) can be seen.","This level is only available if multiple promotions / campaigns are assigned to the

is disabled and/or not valid and/or the given customer does not belong to the target group of the promotion code group, a red icon is shown .","Promotion / Campaign","One or more assigned promotions with promotion name, status, activation date range and assigned application(s) are shown on this level.","If the promotion and the campaign are enabled and valid and the given customer belongs to the target group of the promotion and the campaign, a green icon is shown .","If either the promotion or the campaign is disabled and/or not valid and/or the given customer does not belong to the target group of the promotion and/or the campaign, a red icon is shown .","In case a promotion code group is assigned to multiple promotions, the level Promotion / Campaign is valid if at least one promotion (and the belonging campaign, if existing) is valid.","Tip:","If the promotion is assigned to a campaign, the campaign details will be shown as well.","Invalid or deactivated fields are marked with a warning sign () in order to indicate which fields lead to an invalid/disabled status.","Promotion Code Group, Promotions and Campaigns have links to their master data, so it is possible to jump in for further details or changes.","If a specific customer has been specified in the promotion code search, the following information is shown on the right side of the promotion code search detail view:","Customer","This section contains the customer ID, login, first and last name as well as customer type and status of the given customer.","Related Orders","Under Related Orders all orders of this customer in which this promotion code was used are shown.","The link given in the order number opens the order details.","If the order was deleted, only the order number without link is shown.","Figure 48: Example: Promotion Code Search Detail View","For details on how to perform a promotion code search, refer to Searching Promotion Codes.","Promotion Templates","Marketing managers can create promotions manually or based on a (predefined) set of promotion templates.","Using templates saves time since it is a one-page setup for simple promotions.","Currently, Intershop Commerce Management provides the following promotion templates:","Table 33: Promotion templates","Template Description Example","Free Shipping on Order Value Customer get free shipping if the order value reaches the minimum order value defined by the marketing manager.","Get free shipping for orders €100+.","Fix Discount on Order Value Customer get a fix discount if the order value reaches the minimum

value defined by the marketing manager.","Get 10% off for orders €100+.","Promotion Export and Import","Intershop Commerce Management can","import and export promotions from/to XML files,","import and export promotion codes from/to CSV files, and","import and export promotion code groups from/to XML files.","The promotion import supports the following data:","promotion settings, including ID, name, description, activation time, currency, priority/ranking, calculation type, combination rule settings, budget configuration, campaign settings, promotion code configuration, messages","assignments to applications, target groups (customer segments, affiliate partners), promotion code groups, campaigns, content (page variants, components)","discount rules (discount conditions, discount actions)","Note:","The promotion export/import does not support assignments to specific customers as a target group.","As opposed to the promotion import and the import/export of promotion codes and promotion code groups, the promotion export is based on individual configurations or &quot;scenarios&quot;.","A configuration stores all properties that the export processes need to have to successfully complete the corresponding task.","Multiple configurations can be created, stored and executed, as required by the systems that consume the (export) data later on.","Properties stored by configurations include:","Table 34: Promotion export configuration","Configuration Data Description","General Includes name, ID, description and export file name.","Scheduling Specifies whether the export process based on the current configuration is executed manually or via an automated job at regular intervals.","Promotions Specifies whether promotions should be included dynamically based on specific properties (last changes, activity status, specific start date/end date) or statically by assigning them directly.","For details about managing promotion data exports/imports, see Promotion Data Import and Export .","Gift Cards and Gift Certificates","Gift cards and gift certificates are products of a special type.","Customers can buy gift cards and gift certificates in the storefront and give them to other customers, who are supposed to redeem them.","To this end, gift cards must be enabled as a specific payment method, see Payment Methods.","Gift Cards","A gift card is a physical product, which is shipped to the customer.","Each card must have a PIN and a code, which are usually printed directly on the card.","PIN and code are also displayed on the checkout receipt page, but are not included in the order confirmation e-mail.","Both PIN and code are required to use the card as a payment instrument.","Gift Certificates","A gift certificate is a digital product.","It does not have a PIN.","The code required to redeem it is included in gift certificate confirmation e-mail, which is sent to the customer after the checkout is completed.","A/B Tests What Are A/B Tests?","An A/B test measures the effect of different versions of a promotion or content asset on customer activities in the storefront, such as order generation.","Using A/B tests, promotions and content assets can be tested and optimized until they yield the expected results.","For example, suppose you plan to run a promotion on selected articles to boost online sales, but are not sure whether to use a discount value of 10% or 20% to reach your revenue goals.","The A/B test feature makes it possible to set up a simple test in which both discounts are randomly presented to customers.","While the test runs, the system keeps a detailed record of all customer activities.","Using these data, you can thoroughly evaluate both discount versions, providing a solid basis for your decision.","Possibilities offered by the A/B testing engine in Intershop Commerce Management include:","Promotion and content asset testing","You can test promotions, components, and page variants.","Having evaluated the test results, you can add tested discounts to your campaign list with the click of a mouse.","Multiple test groups","You can define any number of test groups, making it possible to implement simple and complex test scenarios.","Session and cookie stability","The test engine makes sure that users using the same session are presented the same discount and content versions.","Moreover, the system tries to set a cookie in order to identify multiple sessions from the same client for non-registered users.","If the client permits cookies, the system recognizes new sessions, but does not increment the number of participants in the test summary.","If the client does not permit cookies, the system assumes that each new session originates from a new participant.","Working with A/B Tests","Setting Up an A/B test involves the following main tasks:","Creating the Test","Besides name and description, you have to set the start and end date/time during which you want the test to run.","Defining Target Groups and Test Groups","The target group defines which customers are going to participate in the test.","To define the target group, you can select one or more customer segments, affiliate partners or partner programs.","The members of the target group are then distributed proportionally over two or more test groups.","For example, in the most simple case you might setup up two test groups, with 50% of the target group assigned to each.","The test group determines which promotion, content asset, or page variant a test participant will be presented.","Depending on the proportional split, the system randomly assigns customers that belong to the selected target groups to one of the test groups.","One of the test groups serves as control group.","The proportional size of the control group can be set manually, the proportional assignments of the other test groups are then automatically adjusted to make 100%.","For example, when setting up two test groups besides the control group, with the control group being assigned 50% of the target group, the proportional assignment for the test groups is automatically adjusted to 25%.","When changing the assignment for the control group from 50% to 40%, the assignments for the test groups automatically increase to 30%.","Note:","In order to be able to assign customer segments as a target group, at least one segmentation service must be configured for the sales channel ,see Customer Segments.","Assigning Promotions and Content Assets","For each test group, you can assign one or more discounts or content assets.","Note that you do not necessarily have to define a promotion for all test groups, for example you may want to compare a test group which is offered a certain discount (via a promotion) against a control group which is offered no discount at all.","Enabling the Test","The last step in setting up an A/B test is to enable the test.","Viewing Test Results","After the session lifetime has expired and the &quot;UpdateTrackEvents&quot; job has run, you can view the first test results.","For details about these settings, contact your system administrator.","The results are updated on a regular base as the test progresses.","Test results can be viewed via a summary table showing the most important results at a glance, or via detailed breakdowns of all different customer activities that the system tracks.","Planning and Executing A/B Tests","The success of A/B tests largely depends on careful test planning and execution.","As A/B testing is a well-established marketing procedure, it is strongly recommended to consult the existing literature on this topic.","In particular, the following issues are of importance:","Define what to test","Before setting up a test, you should clearly define the overall questions which you want the test to answer.","Keep in mind that a simple A/B Test is appropriate for testing the effect of a single factor, such as &quot;discount value&quot;.","An A/B test is not appropriate for testing the effect of multiple factors at once, or the interaction between factors.","If you need to test the effect of multiple factors, consider running multiple A/B tests.","Use simple test design","The test design pertains to the number of different discount and content versions necessary for the test, and accordingly, the number of test groups.","Make sure the different discount or content versions only vary with respect to the factor whose effect the test is to measure.","For example, if you want to know whether a 10% or a 20% discount is more effective in boosting sales, vary the discount value only and keep everything else identical.","The more differences you introduce, the more difficult the test results are to interpret.","Define criteria for success","During the test, Intershop Commerce Management keeps track of a number of different variables, ranging from the number of sessions to the number of generated orders.","Before running a test, you should clearly define which variables you need to focus on in order to measure success.","Use appropriate sample size","The sample size refers to the number of participants which you need to be able to draw firm conclusions from the test results.","If the sample size is too small, you may miss effects, or misinterpret accidental differences.","If the sample size is too large, basically every difference may seem significant.","A simple way to estimate the sample size is to run a pre-test in which all test groups are exposed to the same discount and content versions.","As soon as the results for the variables of interest match up with each other, the sample size is likely to be sufficient.","Affiliate Partners","Affiliate partner integration provides a powerful, yet easy to handle mechanism to register users who enter the sales channel storefront via an affiliate partner site.","Besides managing affiliate partners, sales channel administrators can also define time-limited partner programs conducted by affiliate partners, which enables an even more fine-grained classification of users.","For each affiliate partner and affiliate partner program, the system generates a special URL which can then be distributed to affiliate partner sites.","On the basis of these URLs, users entering the sales channel storefront via an affiliate partner site are automatically assigned to a customer segment.","Via their assignment to customer segments, affiliate partners and affiliate partner programs can be the target of promotions and discounts.","For each affiliate partner and each affiliate partner program, the system keeps an access statistics which sales channel administrators can view in Commerce Management.","The statistics includes:","Total revenue","Total of orders","Number of registered users","Number of generated storefront hits (sessions).","Search Engine Optimization","Intershop Commerce Management supports SEO-specific page tags, Rich Snippets, locale-specific links and, for tag management, the Google Tag Manager.","SEO-Specific Tags","Product pages and catalog pages of sales channels include specific title and meta tags that optimize Intershop Commerce Management-based storefront pages for web search engines.","The title and meta tag information (page title, meta description and meta keywords) is stored as attributes with products, catalogs and categories.","For details, see SEO Meta Tag Attributes.","If required, Intershop Commerce Management can add specific noindex and nofollow tags to storefront pages.","These tags prevent search engine robots from indexing pages and from following links on them, respectively.","These tags can be set for product pages and category pages as part of catalog/product management, and for page variants as part of content management.","Be aware that selecting this option for page variants overrides any settings made for products or categories.","For details about managing SEO-specific attributes for products and categories, see Managing SEO Attributes for Product Pages and Managing SEO Attributes for Catalog and Category Pages.","For details about setting noindex and nofollow for page variants, see Setting Page Variant SEO Options.","Rich Snippets","Rich Snippets are a micro data format that is included in storefront pages.","It allows web search engines to extract product or catalog information (e.g., prices, types, names) without parsing the HTML content.","If the corresponding ISML templates are prepared accordingly, you can easily switch on or off Rich Snippets for product pages of a channel's storefronts.","For general information about Rich Snippets, refer to Rich Snippets on Google Developers.","For details about how to prepare ISML templates to support Rich Snippets, refer to Cookbook - Product Rich Snippets.","For details about enabling Rich Snippets, see Enabling Rich Snippets for Product Pages.","Locale-Specific Links","Intershop Commerce Management supports links to given storefront pages (product pages, catalog pages, content pages and the Store Finder page) with the same content for all available languages (localizations).","This way, web search engines can provide language-specific or region-specific results, and the content is not regarded as duplicated.","For details about locale-specific links in Intershop Commerce Management, refer to Concept - Language-Specific and Region-Specific URLs.","For details about enabling locale-specific links, see Enabling Locale-Specific Links.","Rich Category Content","Catalog managers can add and maintain &quot;rich content&quot; descriptions for catalogs and categories.","This can be text of any length and any (rich text) formatting, which is to be displayed with the corresponding category pages in the storefront.","In addition, rich category content provides relevant content for web search engines.","For details about working with rich category content, see Managing Rich Category Content.","URL Rewriting","URL rewriting is a mechanism that enables Intershop Commerce Management sites to publish search engine-friendly URLs.","Shop managers can enable or disable this functionality on channel level.","Generally, Intershop Commerce Management can define rules that hide or add specific parts of the visible URLs.","The intention is to provide qualified URLs, which are short and readable and contain enough semantic information to describe the content of the addresses.","Intershop Commerce Management ships with an initial set of URL rewriting rules.","Contact your system administrator if you require new rules or modifications on a project-specific base.","For details about enabling URL rewriting, see Enabling URL Rewriting.","Google Tag Manager","Google Tag Manager is a tool to manage web page tags, including code snippets for conversion tracking, site analytics and others.","Usually, the tags maintained with Google Tag Manager are to be included manually in the intended web pages.","Intershop Commerce Management integrates Google Tag Manager using a dedicated service, which does this job.","For general information about Google Tag Manager, refer to Google Tag Manager website.","For details about setting up Google Tag Manager with Intershop Commerce Management, see Using Google Tag Manager Service.","Short Links and Redirect URLs","The short link mechanism makes it possible to define short URLs (the source URL), which the system internally maps onto complete Intershop Commerce Management URLs (the target URL).","Short links can be used to enable direct access to special storefront pages, such as pages containing special offers or products related to a certain topic.","For example, you can define the short link","http://www.intronics-specials.com","to map on the Intershop Commerce Management URL displaying the products of the respective catalog category:","http://&lt;hostname&gt;/INTERSHOP/web/WFS/inSPIRED-inTRONICS-Site /en_US/-/USD/ViewStandardCatalog-Browse? CatalogID=Specials&amp;CategoryName=Specials","The source URL and the target URL can be either absolute or relative.","Absolute URLs include the protocol (http|https) and the host and may, optionally, specify a port number.","Using relative URLs, however, makes the short links independent from the server.","In data replication scenarios, for example, this allows for preparing a set of short links in an editing environment and simply transferring them to a production system.","Table 35: Absolute URLs in short links","URL Example","Source URL http://&lt;hostname&gt;/inTRONICSDemoStore","Target URL http://&lt;hostname&gt;/INTERSHOP/web/WFS/inSPIRED-inTRONICS-Site/en_US/-/USD/Default-Start Table 36: Relative URLs in short links","URL Example","Source URL /inTRONICSDemoStore","Target URL /INTERSHOP/web/WFS/inSPIRED-inTRONICS-Site/en_US/-/USD/Default-Start","For each short link, a time period can be defined in which the link is valid.","For every domain, one short link can be marked as default.","The link marked as default is used to resolve the target URL if other short links are not valid anymore, for example because their end date has passed.","The short link mechanism can be used to define URL redirects.","This helps to support &quot;moved&quot; URLs (in case, for example, the catalog structure has changed).","Using redirect URLs (301 or 302 server headers) is the most efficient and bot-friendly strategy for online shops to keep stable acquired page ranks with search engines.","To facilitate link management, they can be assigned to link groups.","It is also possible to export short links.","Short links and link groups can be searched via a simple search or an attribute-based advanced search.","Short links do not hide the target server or the complete target URL from the customer.","In fact, what the customer will see when clicking on a short link is the standard URL of the target page.","Also, when browsing other links starting from the target page, standard URLs are displayed as well, and not the short link.","Note:","For short links to work with absolute URLs defined as source URL or target URL, additional configurations are required.","For example, short links may need a DNS entry, enabling clients to resolve the address behind the short URL.","Contact your system administrator.","For short links with relative URLs defined as source URL or target URL, no additional configuration is required.","Tip:","Most search engines will rank down sites with insecure URLs.","Web applications can use secure URLs in order to achieve a good search index position.","More detailed information on how to achieve this can be found in the Organization Management User Guide | Manage Site Settings | Secure URL only server configuration.","Product Data Feeds","Product data feeds are files that contain information about the products listed on your site.","They are used to &quot;feed&quot; this information to search engines, product comparison Web sites, and other similar aggregators of e-commerce information.","Intershop Commerce Management supports multiple product data feed formats, including:","Standard Intershop XML","Sitemap XML","Feed Dynamix Feed","Product RSS Feed","For details about product data feeds, supported formats etc., see Product Data Feeds: Concepts.","Landing Pages","Generally, landing pages are pages that appear when potential customers click an advertisement or a search-engine result link.","A landing page will usually display content that is logically related to the content of the originating Web site.","With Intershop Commerce Management, landing pages are used to test a variety of particular &quot;entry pages&quot; to the storefront.","In combination with a dedicated service provided by Intershop Online Marketing, this helps you to evaluate the user acceptance of specific content elements, layouts etc.","Landing pages are static HTML pages that link to your storefront.","Using an according URL rewrite rule, you can publish search-engine friendly URLs for your landing pages.","Intershop Online Marketing can, when contracted accordingly, track and evaluate the traffic generated through these pages.","For more details about managing landing pages, see Landing Page Management.","E-Mail Marketing","Intershop Commerce Management offers an e-mail marketing component that distributes newsletters or other marketing messages to configurable groups of recipients.","This solution provides, among others:","Optimized newsletter creation thanks to the deep integration of Intershop Commerce Management with the newsletter management","Direct e-mail appeals to &quot;shop-dropouts&quot;, offering, for example, shopping coupons","Note:","The Newsletter Management tool included with the Online Marketing section becomes operational after properly setting the e-mail marketing preferences, see Configuring E-Mail Marketing.","Intershop Commerce Management supports e-mail marketing campaigns through the integration of eCircle-messenger (eC-m).","The necessary adapter cartridge (ac_ecircle) is installed and initialized by default, but not yet operational.","For details about enabling and configuring eCircle, see Configuring E-Mail Marketing.","Note:","On request, Intershop can integrate e-mail marketing providers other than eCircle-messenger.","Online Marketing Management: Concepts","./con_mkt.html","71,4","7 Jan 2019");

final page.","Components are of a specific component type, which defines the structure (slots, see above) and any parameters required for rendering the component.","Depending on the component type, each component may require a specific set of configuration parameters, e.g., a link to a product or an image.","Both rendering and configuration parameters are defined in Intershop Studio.","The values for configuration parameters, however, can be edited in Commerce Management or directly in the storefront, using the Design View.","With &quot;dynamic slots&quot;, i.e., using implicit component associations, all components of a defined type can be displayed automatically in the corresponding slot without being explicitly assigned.","Tip:","Commerce Management can display a list of component types, showing the parameters, slots, etc., that are available in a given management context.","Includes","An include can be conceived of as an &quot;entry point&quot; for individual components.","There are two types of includes:","system includes: are development artifacts and thus, their life cycle is completely managed by the system; on runtime, users can only configure and assign components to them","user-generated includes: constitute a means to define reusable sets of &quot;display configurations&quot; for business objects; can currently be created by catalog managers in the context of catalog categories and products to allow for defining specific &quot;views&quot;, or by content managers with new view contexts","View Contexts","View contexts relate business objects like products or categories with pages or includes for a given context like category browsing or checkout.","That is, they represent an environment where given objects are to be displayed in a certain way.","Page Templates","Page templates constitute page variant &quot;models&quot;.","A page template is based on a variant type, thus defining the structure and rendering parameters for the page variants derived from the template.","Page templates can be &quot;pre-filled&quot; with components (which cannot be modified in derived page variants) and can hold placeholders, see below.","Component Templates","Component templates constitute component &quot;models&quot;.","A component template is based on a component type, thus defining the structure and rendering parameters for the components derived from the template.","Component templates can be &quot;pre-filled&quot; with other components (which cannot be modified in derived components) and can, if allowed by the type, hold placeholders, see below.","Placeholders","Placeholders define editable areas in page variants or components that are derived from templates.","If provided for by their corresponding types, page or component templates can &quot;propagate&quot; their slots to their derived page variants or components via placeholders.","Content Templates","This section gives a high-level overview of the options introduced with templating.","It illustrates the general approach and the benefit of using page or component templates.","Figure 31: Template usage","On development time, a pagelet model is created in Intershop Studio.","This model defines a page variant type with three slots.","After system deployment, this type is available in Commerce Management for content managers.","In Commerce Management, a content manager creates a page template based on this page variant type.","Slot 1 is filled with a component, which cannot be modified in page variants derived from this template.","Slot 2 is passed forward as editing area using a placeholder.","Slot 3 is filled with a component template that contains two slots, which are also forwarded as editing areas using placeholders.","Based on this page template, a content manager creates a page variant that provides three editable areas.","Roles and Tasks","Content management, i.e., managing the content assets listed above, involves the following roles: content manager, content editor, content viewer and content preference manager.","Content managers are responsible for creating and modifying page templates and component templates as well as for actually managing the content, that is they create, edit, combine, etc.","the pages, page variants, components, includes and content views.","Content editors create and edit pages, page variants, components, includes and content views.","As opposed to content managers, they cannot, however, create, manage or delete page templates and component templates.","Content viewers can just view content assets.","Content preference managers can configure settings that impact the content management area.","Caution:","Be aware that the content assets, their possible configurations, interactions with the Intershop Commerce Management system, etc.","are defined by their corresponding types, which must be created upon system development in Intershop Studio.","Once the system is deployed, i.e., on runtime, content managers or content editors make use of the implemented functionality.","The following sections give a rough overview of the main tasks content management users can perform in Commerce Management.","Content Manager","As already mentioned, content managers manage the page templates and component templates as well as pages, page variants, components, includes and content views.","This involves the following main tasks:","Creating templates","When creating a new page or component template, the content manager must select a &quot;parent&quot; template from which the new template inherits its variant/component type.","Thus, all other templates or page variants/components derived from this template will inherit the same general structure and configuration parameters.","Adding content and placeholders to templates","Content managers can add content components to templates, which then will be visible on the finally rendered storefront page but cannot be modified by content managers when managing page variants or components derived from this template.","To provide editable areas on the page variants or components derived from this template, content managers can add placeholders, which &quot;propagate&quot; the slots as defined by the variant/component type.","Deleting user-created templates","Page or component templates created by content managers can be removed.","The &quot;first-level&quot; templates, which are available upon system initialization, are representations of the available variant or component types and hence, cannot be deleted.","Caution:","Deleting user-created templates removes all assets derived from these templates (page variants, components, placeholder-based slots, etc.) as well.","Creating pages","In addition to the system-managed pages generated upon system initialization, content managers can create new pages.","For new pages, the content manager must select a page type, which defines the general structure and configuration parameters.","Note:","The page types of system-managed pages are not available for user-generated pages.","Editing pages","Editing pages involves configuring the required parameters, setting page properties, assigning page variants, creating subpages and managing page labels.","Creating and editing page variants","When creating a new page variant, the content manager must select a page template from which the new variant inherits the variant type and thus the general structure and configuration parameters.","Editing page variants involves configuring the required parameters, adding and managing content components, setting page variant properties as well as managing page variant labels.","Note:","Page variants intended to be displayed with catalog categories or products, i.e., page variants to be associated with category or product pages, are available for catalog managers when editing categories or products.","Creating and editing components","When creating a new content component, the content manager must select a component template from which the new component inherits the component type and thus the general structure and configuration parameters.","Editing components involves configuring the required parameters, adding, modifying or removing content, setting component properties as well as managing component labels.","Editing includes","Editing includes involves configuring the required parameters, adding and managing content components, setting available include properties as well as managing include labels.","Creating and editing view contexts","When creating a new view context, the content manager must select a view context type, which sets the intended &quot;view environment&quot;.","Editing view contexts involves configuring the required parameters and fallbacks, managing the assignments of products/categories and pages/includes, as well as setting available view context properties.","Content Editor","Content editors create and edit pages, page variants, components, includes and content views.","As opposed to content managers, they cannot, however, create, manage or delete page templates and component templates.","Consequently, this involves the following tasks:","Creating and editing pages","Creating and editing page variants","Creating and editing components","Editing includes","Creating and editing view contexts","For task details, see Content Manager.","Content Viewer","Content viewers can only view pages, page variants, components, includes and content views.","Content Preference Manager","As outlined above, content preference managers configure settings that impact the content management area.","Currently, this involves the following task:","Setting content lock period","The content preference manager defines the time for which content objects are locked for editing.","During this time, a content object cannot be edited by other users.","Sharing Content Assets","Content sharing enables organizations to centrally maintain master content assets, which are to be distributed and displayed unaltered across the selected channels, and channels to centrally maintain content, which is to be distributed and displayed unaltered across the selected channel applications.","Note:","At the same time, each channel and each application can locally create and manage individual content, which is then available in the context of this channel or application only.","That is, content assets can be shared","from the sales organization to its sales channels and partner channels,","from a sales channel to its applications, and","from a partner channel to its assigned partner organizations.","Managing Content Assets","Depending on an organization's business model and, consequently, the implementation of the storefront application(s), content managers and content editors can access and edit content assets on three levels: the organization, the channel or the application.","Using the context selection box (as described in User Interface Overview), content managers and content editors select the intended context (or level), and then access the content assets via the Commerce Management tools introduced below.","Note:","The modification of content models in Intershop Studio makes it necessary to synchronize already instantiated runtime artifacts.","To this end, Intershop Commerce Management provides the pre-configured job &quot;Synchronize Page Model and Pagelet Instances&quot;.","Ask the system administrator of your Intershop Commerce Management system to schedule or run this job.","Content Overview","The Content Overview shows overall content asset statistics and provides assistance in identifying and correcting missing data.","The page is divided into two sections: Content Overview and Content Completeness.","The Content Overview section displays statistical information about content objects, including the number of pages, number of page variants, number of page templates, number of components, number of component templates, number of includes and number of view contexts.","The Content Completeness section displays, based on the selected language, reports on missing mandatory configuration parameters and empty slots/placeholders, individually compiled for pages, page variants, page templates, components, component templates, includes and view contexts.","Figure 32: Content Overview Page Manager","The Page Manager is divided into two tabs: Tree View and List View.","The tree view shows a representation of the current site's page structure.","Using the tree view, content managers can lock pages for editing () and copy the page (, only user-generated pages).","In addition,
