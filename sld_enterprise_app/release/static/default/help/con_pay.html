      <p id="d12e24741">Additional payment methods can be provided through dedicated payment provider cartridges. The central system administrator

         and the corresponding applications.

      <h2 id="con_pay_handle">Payment Method Handling</h2>
      <p id="d12e24746">Intershop Commerce Management integrates payment methods as "services" via dedicated service provider cartridges, see <a href="con_serv.html#con_serv">Services</a>. To make payment methods technically available on the organization, channel or application level, system managers create
         "service configurations", which represent a configurable association between a service type and the given management context.
         The business-relevant settings for payment methods, however, are defined in the context of sales channel only.

      <h3 id="con_pay_app">Payment Method Applications</h3>

      <h3 id="con_pay_cost">Payment Costs</h3>
      <p id="d12e24771">Payment methods can be associated with a cost to be charged if the payment method is selected. Payment costs can be defined
         for any available currency. When defining payment costs, the following values can be provided:
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e24773">
         <li id="d12e24774">
            <p id="d12e24775">Minimum Order Value</p>
            <p id="d12e24777">This value defines the minimum order value which must be reached for the payment cost to become effective. Orders below the
               minimum order value will not be charged with a cost for the selected payment method. If left empty, no minimum order value
               applies.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e24779">
            <p id="d12e24780">Amount</p>
            <p id="d12e24782">This value determines the cost to be charged for the respective payment method. Only positive values can be supplied. Note
               that a specific taxation policy can be defined for the payment cost amount, determining whether (and to which extent) the
               defined payment cost is included in the tax calculation. For example, if value "NoTax" is selected, the payment cost is not
               included when calculating the due tax. On the other hand, if "FullTax" is selected, the payment costs are included in the
               tax calculation process and subject to the standard tax rate.

         <li id="d12e24784">
            <p id="d12e24785">Threshold</p>
            <p id="d12e24787">This value defines the maximum order value up to which the payment cost applies. Orders with an order value equal to or above
               the threshold will not be charged with a cost for the selected payment method. If left empty, no maximum order value applies.

         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e24790">Apart from defining payment costs, you can also use this feature to restrict payment methods to orders equal to or above a
            certain order value. For example, to restrict the payment method "Direct Credit Card Entry" to orders with a minimum order
            value of 10 EUR, set the "Minimum Order Value" for this payment method to 10 EUR and leave the "Amount" field empty.

      <h3 id="con_pay_assign">Customer Segment Assignments</h3>
      <p id="d12e24795">Each payment method can be made available to all customers or to selected customer segments, see <a href="con_cons.html#con_cons_segm">Customer Segments</a>. Payment methods can also be assigned to the group "No One", which means they are unavailable to customers in the storefront.
