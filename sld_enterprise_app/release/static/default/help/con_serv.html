      <p id="d12e30406">Intershop Commerce Management provides service interfaces for integrating business services like Web analytics, mail, order,
         PIM or ERP solutions via dedicated service provider cartridges. Once a service provider cartridge is installed, the system
         administrator makes the new services available to the sales organizations using Organization Management (the central administration
         front end). Once propagated to the organization, the services are immediately available on all three management contexts or
         "hierarchy levels", i.e., within the organization, its dependent channels and their corresponding applications.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30408">In order to actually use a service, system managers create "service configurations" on the organization, channel or application
         level, which represent a configurable association between a service type and the given management context.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30410">When managing service configurations, the following characteristics are relevant:</p>
      <ul class="disc" id="d12e30412">
         <li id="d12e30413">
            <p id="d12e30414">You can create multiple (different) service configurations for one service type.</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30416">
            <p id="d12e30417">Service configurations can be shared with the dependent management contexts, applying several activation rules (shared and
               active, shared and inactive, shared and mandatory, unshared).
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30419">
            <p id="d12e30420">In case a service configuration is shared, changing the availability status in the management context, in which it has been
               created, directly affects the operability in all dependent management contexts.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e30422">The following figure illustrates a simple service configuration sharing scenario, with an additional local service configuration
         in the application context.
      </p>

      <p id="d12e30430">Generally, this allows for implementing even complex scenarios. Think of individual search service configurations, for example,
         for multiple storefront applications in one sales channel. In this case, you would create multiple different service configurations
         of the same type in the sales channel and share them with all applications as inactive. For each application, you would then
         individually activate the one service configuration that is intended for the current application.

         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e30433">Be aware that technically you can create configurations for all types of services in all management contexts. This is, however,
            not necessary or not sensible with respect to all services. Some services may be fully operational only on channel level.
            For information about your individual system environment, contact your system administrator.

      <h2 id="con_serv_search">Search Index Services</h2>
      <p id="d12e30442">To provide powerful storefront search options, like full-text search or dynamic navigation, Intershop Commerce Management
         integrates third-party search engines via dedicated adapter cartridges. Once implemented and enabled, the integrated search
         builds and queries specific index files located in the site's file system structure.

      <p id="d12e30451">With an integrated search engine, the Mass Data section of Commerce Management integrates a dedicated Search Index manager.
         Use this manager to enable, configure and build the search indexes, which then serve as the base for the intended advanced
         search options in the storefront.

      <h2 id="con_serv_tax">Tax Calculation Services</h2>
      <p id="d12e30461">Tax calculation services calculate the possible difference between a given price type (net or gross) and a selected price
         display preference (net or gross). Intershop Commerce Management provides two standard services that determine the net price
         or the gross price as required for display purposes:
