      <h2 id="con_mkt_wflow">Overview</h2>
      <p id="d12e19601">In Intershop Commerce Management, "online marketing" summarizes traditional marketing tools like promotions and promotional
         codes as well as online marketing functions. These include support for several search engine optimization and marketing tasks
         like setting SEO meta tag attributes, URL redirecting, or data feed generation.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e19603">The main tasks involved in managing online marketing activities are:</p>

            <p id="d12e19607">Managing Promotions and Promotional Codes</p>
            <p id="d12e19609">Promotions are one of the basic online marketing tools. A promotion defines a discount and determines a target group to which
               the discount is made available. Promotions can be based on coupons, which customers redeem by supplying the coupon code when
               placing an order. Furthermore, promotions can be associated with content components via content relations.

            <p id="d12e19618">Gift cards and gift certificates are products of a special type. They can be bought by customers in the storefront either
               digitally ("gift certificates") or physically ("gift cards").
            </p>

            <p id="d12e19627">A/B tests provide a simple and powerful tool to test the effect that different promotions have on customer activity in the
               storefront. For example, you may want to set up two identical promotions, then change a single parameter in one of them. You
               can then use A/B testing to find out how the change affects customer behavior. Do customers add more products to their baskets,
               or does the number of orders increase?
            </p>

      <h2 id="con_mkt_promo">Promotions and Campaigns</h2>
      <p id="d12e19673">Promotions are the main tool for your online marketing activities and can help you to draw customers to your site and increase
         sales. Generally, promotions define some sort of discount or benefit and determine a target group to which the discount should
         be made available.
      </p>
      <div class="note" id="d12e19675">
         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e19676">Defining a target group is optional. If no target group is defined, the promotion does not apply to any customer.</p>
      </div>
      <p id="d12e19678">You may furthermore restrict access to promotions by distributing promotional codes (in the form of coupons) amongst your
         target audience. Customers then need to provide the promotional code in order to prove that they are entitled to the promotion.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e19680">Another feature of promotions is that they can be associated with content components via content relations. Hence, promotions
         constitute an instrument for content personalization. Creating promotions that specify only target groups and associated content
         components (i.e., promotions without discounts) enables shop operators to publish target group-specific content.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e19682">Campaigns provide a means to combine multiple promotions. In addition, marketing managers can assign dedicated CMS page variants
         or components to campaigns as well as define specific target groups and validity periods for campaigns.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e19684">The following terms and concepts are essential with respect to promotion management:</p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e19686">
         <li id="d12e19687">
            <p id="d12e19688">General Promotion Details</p>
            <p id="d12e19690">General promotion details include the promotion name, an ID, a description, settings on how a promotion can be combined with
               other promotions, the activation period, and budget details.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19692">
            <p id="d12e19693">Promotion Ranking</p>
            <p id="d12e19695">Since Intershop Commerce Management permits you to run multiple promotions at the same time, it may happen that several valid
               promotions apply to one basket. To define the calculation order of the promotions, marketing administrators can define a rank
               for each promotion. As a result, the promotion with the highest rank is calculated first.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19697">
            <p id="d12e19698">Promotion Target Group</p>
            <p id="d12e19700">The target group of a promotion can be a special customer segment (e.g., all first-time shoppers, or all recurring customers)
               or customers individually selected from the pool of users registered with the channel. Promotions can also be targeted at
               customers that are associated with affiliate partners or affiliate partner programs.
            </p>
            <div class="note" id="d12e19702">
               <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
               <p id="d12e19703">In order to be able to assign customer segments as a target group, at least one segmentation service must be configured for
                  the sales channel, see <a href="con_cons.html#con_cons_segm">Customer Segments</a>.
               </p>
            </div>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19707">
            <p id="d12e19708">Discount Rule, Promotion Condition, Promotion Discount</p>
            <p id="d12e19710">For each promotion you can define one or more discount rules. Each discount rule itself defines one or more conditions and
               a discount.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e19712">Multiple conditions can be combined by logical operators <span class="emphasis">AND</span> and <span class="emphasis">OR</span> to form a single expression. This expression evaluates to either True or False. If the conditional part of the rule is True,
               then the promotion is applied and the customer will get the discount defined by the rule.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e19720">For example, you could create a discount rule that says trigger the promotion when the customer places at least five items
               in the basket or spends more than 100 USD on a single item from a specific product category. If these conditions are met,
               apply a 10% financial discount.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e19722">Thus you can create very powerful discount rules allowing you to model even the most complex marketing strategy in a very
               flexible way.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19724">
            <p id="d12e19725">Promotion Codes</p>
            <p id="d12e19727">Promotion Codes provide an additional means to propagate the promotion to the target group. For example, promotion codes could
               be distributed amongst the target audience via newspaper, radio, or TV advertisements. Customers who want to benefit from
               the promotion will need to enter the promotion code during the order checkout process.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19729">
            <p id="d12e19730">Dynamic Basket Message</p>
            <p id="d12e19732">For each discount rule you can set up an individual dynamic message that will be displayed when the promotion has not been
               triggered yet but is close to being triggered. Using this feature, you could for example display a message on the basket page
               saying "Add 2 more items to your basket to receive free shipping!".
            </p>
            <p id="d12e19734">The threshold that triggers the displaying of the dynamic message is configurable for each promotion independently.</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19736">
            <p id="d12e19737">Promotion Messaging</p>
            <p id="d12e19739">Promotion messaging contains an icon and various texts that will appear in the context of promoted products, e.g., on catalog
               or product detail pages. The default configuration is to display an icon, a short title and a long title component along with
               a details link on product details pages. When the storefront user clicks the details link, an overlay pop-up opens comprising
               a long title, descriptive text, and legal disclaimer text.
            </p>

            <p id="d12e19742">Content Relations</p>
            <p id="d12e19744">You can set up content relations that associate the promotion with specific CMS-based page variants or components.</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19746">
            <p id="d12e19747">General Promotion Preferences</p>
            <p id="d12e19749">Promotion preferences that apply to all promotions in a given sales channel include promotion budget sources, promotion type
               priorities and the validity expiration behavior.

               <li id="d12e19752">
                  <p id="d12e19753">A budget source is like a tag you can use to categorize a promotion's budget. You may, for example, define a budget source
                     for promotions aimed at partners, and another one set up for employees. Currently the budget source has no further effect
                     on the promotion or its budget.

                  <p id="d12e19756">The promotion type priority specifies in which order various promotion types are to be applied when calculating discounts.
                     The priorities set for the sales channel can be overridden by promotion-specific settings.

                  <p id="d12e19759">The validity behavior setting specifies whether a promotion is still applicable for a running session even after the time
                     or the budget has expired.

      <h3 id="con_mkt_promo_rules">Discount Rules</h3>
      <h4 id="con_mkt_promo_rules_condt">Promotion Conditions</h4>
      <p id="d12e19771">When defining discount rules you specify the conditions that trigger the promotion. Triggering a promotion means, that the
         promotional benefit is applied to either a product in the customer's basket or the entire order.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e19773">In a discount rule, multiple conditions can be combined using the logical operators <span class="emphasis">AND</span> and <span class="emphasis">OR</span> to build complex Boolean expressions. For example you may create an expression constructed from the following conditions:
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e19781">
         <li id="d12e19782">
            <p id="d12e19783">the numbers of items in the basket is greater than 10</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19785">
            <p id="d12e19786">the order total is greater than 100 USD</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e19788">
            <p id="d12e19789">the customer-selected shipping method is "ship to store"</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e19791">Assuming that you combine all these conditions using <span class="emphasis">AND</span> operators, the promotion will be triggered when each of the sub-conditions is True.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e19796">If an expression contains both logical operators (<span class="emphasis">AND</span> and <span class="emphasis">OR</span>), the <span class="emphasis">AND</span> operator takes precedence over the <span class="emphasis">OR</span> operator. For example, if you create an expression consisting of three conditions like this <span class="emphasis">C1 AND C2 OR C3</span>, the sub-expression <span class="emphasis">C1 AND C2</span> is evaluated first and the result of the expression is afterwards OR-combined with <span class="emphasis">C3</span>.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e19820">The various conditions you can choose from fall into four categories, see the following table for details:</p>

                  period, the promotion will be active. Thus you may configure a promotion to be only available on a certain week-day or on
                  a certain day of the month. By specifying an intraday period, you may define a daily start and an end time for the promotion.

      <h3 id="con_mkt_abtest_whatis">What Are A/B Tests?</h3>
      <p id="d12e20353">An A/B test measures the effect of different versions of a promotion or content asset on customer activities in the storefront,
         such as order generation. Using A/B tests, promotions and content assets can be tested and optimized until they yield the
         expected results.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e20355">For example, suppose you plan to run a promotion on selected articles to boost online sales, but are not sure whether to use
         a discount value of 10% or 20% to reach your revenue goals. The A/B test feature makes it possible to set up a simple test
         in which both discounts are randomly presented to customers. While the test runs, the system keeps a detailed record of all
         customer activities. Using these data, you can thoroughly evaluate both discount versions, providing a solid basis for your
         decision.
      </p>

            <p id="d12e20373">The test engine makes sure that users using the same session are presented the same discount and content versions. Moreover,
               the system tries to set a cookie in order to identify multiple sessions from the same client for non-registered users. If
               the client permits cookies, the system recognizes new sessions, but does not increment the number of participants in the test
               summary. If the client does not permit cookies, the system assumes that each new session originates from a new participant.

         <li id="d12e20386">
            <p id="d12e20387">Defining Target Groups and Test Groups</p>
            <p id="d12e20389">The target group defines which customers are going to participate in the test. To define the target group, you can select
               one or more customer segments, affiliate partners or partner programs. The members of the target group are then distributed
               proportionally over two or more test groups. For example, in the most simple case you might setup up two test groups, with
               50% of the target group assigned to each. The test group determines which promotion, content asset, or page variant a test
               participant will be presented. Depending on the proportional split, the system randomly assigns customers that belong to the
               selected target groups to one of the test groups.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e20391">One of the test groups serves as control group. The proportional size of the control group can be set manually, the proportional
               assignments of the other test groups are then automatically adjusted to make 100%. For example, when setting up two test groups
               besides the control group, with the control group being assigned 50% of the target group, the proportional assignment for
               the test groups is automatically adjusted to 25%. When changing the assignment for the control group from 50% to 40%, the
               assignments for the test groups automatically increase to 30%.

      <h3 id="con_mkt_abtest_exec">Planning and Executing A/B Tests</h3>
      <p id="d12e20418">The success of A/B tests largely depends on careful test planning and execution. As A/B testing is a well-established marketing
         procedure, it is strongly recommended to consult the existing literature on this topic. In particular, the following issues
         are of importance:
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e20420">
         <li id="d12e20421">
            <p id="d12e20422">Define what to test</p>
            <p id="d12e20424">Before setting up a test, you should clearly define the overall questions which you want the test to answer. Keep in mind
               that a simple A/B Test is appropriate for testing the effect of a single factor, such as "discount value". An A/B test is
               not appropriate for testing the effect of multiple factors at once, or the interaction between factors. If you need to test
               the effect of multiple factors, consider running multiple A/B tests.
            </p>

         <li id="d12e20426">
            <p id="d12e20427">Use simple test design</p>
            <p id="d12e20429">The test design pertains to the number of different discount and content versions necessary for the test, and accordingly,
               the number of test groups. Make sure the different discount or content versions only vary with respect to the factor whose
               effect the test is to measure. For example, if you want to know whether a 10% or a 20% discount is more effective in boosting
               sales, vary the discount value only and keep everything else identical. The more differences you introduce, the more difficult
               the test results are to interpret.

               If the sample size is too small, you may miss effects, or misinterpret accidental differences. If the sample size is too large,
               basically every difference may seem significant. A simple way to estimate the sample size is to run a pre-test in which all
               test groups are exposed to the same discount and content versions. As soon as the results for the variables of interest match
               up with each other, the sample size is likely to be sufficient.

      <h2 id="con_mkt_afm">Affiliate Partners</h2>
      <p id="d12e20444">Affiliate partner integration provides a powerful, yet easy to handle mechanism to register users who enter the sales channel
         storefront via an affiliate partner site. Besides managing affiliate partners, sales channel administrators can also define
         time-limited partner programs conducted by affiliate partners, which enables an even more fine-grained classification of users.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e20446">For each affiliate partner and affiliate partner program, the system generates a special URL which can then be distributed
         to affiliate partner sites. On the basis of these URLs, users entering the sales channel storefront via an affiliate partner
         site are automatically assigned to a customer segment. Via their assignment to customer segments, affiliate partners and affiliate
         partner programs can be the target of promotions and discounts.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e20448">For each affiliate partner and each affiliate partner program, the system keeps an access statistics which sales channel administrators
         can view in Commerce Management. The statistics includes:

      <h3 id="con_mkt_seo_tag">SEO-Specific Tags</h3>
      <p id="d12e20471">Product pages and catalog pages of sales channels include specific title and meta tags that optimize Intershop Commerce Management-based
         storefront pages for web search engines. The title and meta tag information (page title, meta description and meta keywords)
         is stored as attributes with products, catalogs and categories. For details, see <a href="con_cat.html#con_cat_seo">SEO Meta Tag Attributes</a>.

      <p id="d12e20475">If required, Intershop Commerce Management can add specific <span class="code">noindex</span> and <span class="code">nofollow</span> tags to storefront pages. These tags prevent search engine robots from indexing pages and from following links on them, respectively.
         These tags can be set for product pages and category pages as part of catalog/product management, and for page variants as
         part of content management. Be aware that selecting this option for page variants overrides any settings made for products

      <h3 id="con_mkt_seo_richSnip">Rich Snippets</h3>
      <p id="d12e20502">Rich Snippets are a micro data format that is included in storefront pages. It allows web search engines to extract product
         or catalog information (e.g., prices, types, names) without parsing the HTML content. If the corresponding ISML templates
         are prepared accordingly, you can easily switch on or off Rich Snippets for product pages of a channel's storefronts.

      <h3 id="con_mkt_seo_richCont">Rich Category Content</h3>
      <p id="d12e20535">Catalog managers can add and maintain "rich content" descriptions for catalogs and categories. This can be text of any length
         and any (rich text) formatting, which is to be displayed with the corresponding category pages in the storefront. In addition,
         rich category content provides relevant content for web search engines.

      <p id="d12e20544">URL rewriting is a mechanism that enables Intershop Commerce Management sites to publish search engine-friendly URLs. Shop
         managers can enable or disable this functionality on channel level.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e20546">Generally, Intershop Commerce Management can define rules that hide or add specific parts of the visible URLs. The intention
         is to provide qualified URLs, which are short and readable and contain enough semantic information to describe the content
         of the addresses. Intershop Commerce Management ships with an initial set of URL rewriting rules. Contact your system administrator
         if you require new rules or modifications on a project-specific base.

      <h2 id="con_mkt_slink">Short Links and Redirect URLs</h2>
      <p id="d12e20570">The short link mechanism makes it possible to define short URLs (the source URL), which the system internally maps onto complete
         Intershop Commerce Management URLs (the target URL). Short links can be used to enable direct access to special storefront
         pages, such as pages containing special offers or products related to a certain topic. For example, you can define the short
         link
      </p><pre class="code" id="d12e20572">http://www.intronics-specials.com</pre><p id="d12e20574">to map on the Intershop Commerce Management URL displaying the products of the respective catalog category:</p><pre class="code" id="d12e20576">http://&lt;hostname&gt;/INTERSHOP/web/WFS/inSPIRED-inTRONICS-Site
/en_US/-/USD/ViewStandardCatalog-Browse?
CatalogID=Specials&amp;CategoryName=Specials</pre><p id="d12e20578">The source URL and the target URL can be either absolute or relative. Absolute URLs include the protocol (<span class="code">http|https</span>) and the host and may, optionally, specify a port number. Using relative URLs, however, makes the short links independent
         from the server. In data replication scenarios, for example, this allows for preparing a set of short links in an editing
         environment and simply transferring them to a production system.

      <p id="d12e20633">For each short link, a time period can be defined in which the link is valid. For every domain, one short link can be marked
         as default. The link marked as default is used to resolve the target URL if other short links are not valid anymore, for example
         because their end date has passed.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e20635">The short link mechanism can be used to define URL redirects. This helps to support "moved" URLs (in case, for example, the
         catalog structure has changed). Using redirect URLs (301 or 302 server headers) is the most efficient and bot-friendly strategy
         for online shops to keep stable acquired page ranks with search engines.

      <p id="d12e20637">To facilitate link management, they can be assigned to link groups. It is also possible to export short links.</p>
      <p id="d12e20640">Short links and link groups can be searched via a simple search or an attribute-based advanced search.</p>
      <p id="d12e20642">Short links do not hide the target server or the complete target URL from the customer. In fact, what the customer will see
         when clicking on a short link is the standard URL of the target page. Also, when browsing other links starting from the target
         page, standard URLs are displayed as well, and not the short link.

         <p id="d12e20645">For short links to work with absolute URLs defined as source URL or target URL, additional configurations are required. For
            example, short links may need a DNS entry, enabling clients to resolve the address behind the short URL. Contact your system
