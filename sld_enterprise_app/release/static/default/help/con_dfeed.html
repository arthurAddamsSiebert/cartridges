      <h2 id="con_dfeed_whatis">What Are Product Data Feeds?</h2>
      <p id="d12e4424">Product data feeds provide the possibility to externalize the content of the product repository to different types of targets:
         either to files of a specific format, or to a separate Intershop Commerce Management system (target system).
      </p>
      <p id="d12e4426">For details about managing product data feeds, see <a href="task_pim_dfeed.html#task_pim_dfeed">Managing Product Data Feeds</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="con_dfeed_whatis_file">Product Data Feed to a File</h3>
      <p id="d12e4433">If the target of externalization is a file, product data feeds work similar to - and serve similar purposes as - export processes.
         In fact, they rely on the same internal operations. However, product data feeds go beyond standard product export with respect
         to the following features:
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e4435">
         <li id="d12e4436">
            <p id="d12e4437">Export to different XML formats</p>
            <p id="d12e4439">Product data feeds allow you to determine the formatting of XML data in the resulting export file. By default, product data
               feeds support exports to Intershop XML, Sitemap XML, Feed Dynamix Feed and Product RSS Feed. For details, see <a href="con_dfeed.html#con_dfeed_targets">Product Data Feed Targets</a>.

         <li id="d12e4443">
            <p id="d12e4444">Data transformation before export</p>
            <p id="d12e4446">Similar to the product syndication process, product data feeds support attribute mapping. This enables you to modify data
               structures as required, e.g., by changing attribute names or transforming attribute values. The mechanism can also be used
               to control which attributes are to be exported, and which are not.

            <p id="d12e4449">Scheduled exports</p>
            <p id="d12e4451">Product data feeds can be triggered manually in Commerce Management, or via an automated job at regular intervals.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="con_dfeed_whatis_target">Product Data Feed to an Intershop Commerce Management Target System</h3>
      <p id="d12e4456">In cases like this, the product data feed is used to selectively transfer product data (database content and related file
         system content, including images, thumbnails and attachments) from a source to a target system, similar to data replication.
         In fact, the product data feed - if used to transfer product data to a target system - relies on the same environment as data
         replication in terms of architecture, setup and configuration of the source and target system. However, the underlying mechanisms
         to actually transfer data are entirely different. With product data transfer using the product data feed, data objects are
         converted to WebObjects and serialized by Apache Axis. A Web service residing at the target system is then used to deserialize
         the WebObjects and merge the data into the target system's database.
      </p>
      <div class="note" id="d12e4458">
         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e4459">In contrast to data replication, the product data feed is designed to transfer small sets of data, for example individual
            products that have been modified on the source system, with the changes having to be transfered immediately to the target
            system.
         </p>
      </div>
      <p id="d12e4461">When using the product data feed to transfer product data to a target system, the following specific issues are important:</p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e4463">
         <li id="d12e4464">
            <p id="d12e4465">System Environment</p>
            <p id="d12e4467">Before the product data feed to a target system can be used, the system administrator has to set up source and target system
               and prepare them for data transfer. The steps are identical to the steps necessary to prepare the source and target system
               for data replication. System administrators can refer to the <span class="emphasis">Intershop Commerce Management Administration and Configuration Guide</span> for a detailed description of these steps.

            <p id="d12e4473">Modification of Live Tables</p>
            <p id="d12e4475">Transferring product data from a source to a target system using the product data feed directly affects the target system's
               live tables. In contrast to product data transfer using data replication, table switching is not involved.

         <li id="d12e4477">
            <p id="d12e4478">Impact on Page Caching</p>
            <p id="d12e4480">If the data transfer via the product data feed has been successful, all affected pages in the page cache are invalidated,
               using the selective page cache deletion mechanism.

      <p id="d12e4501">The configuration stores all properties that the internal export processes need to have to successfully complete a product
         data feed task. Multiple configurations can be created, stored and executed, as required by the systems that consume the data
         later on. Properties stored by configurations include:

         see <a href="con_mdata.html#con_mdata_sdc_mapping">Attribute Mapping Rules</a>. In contrast to product syndication, however, the result of the mapping process is not persisted to the database, but only
         written to the export file.
