      <h2 id="con_order_wflow">Order Process Overview</h2>
      <p id="d12e24414">Handling orders is one of the key processes of Intershop Commerce Management. Main stages through which an order passes include:</p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e24416">
         <li id="d12e24417">
            <p id="d12e24418">Creating Orders and Order Submission</p>
            <p id="d12e24420">Customers browse catalogs in the sales channel storefront, select products, add products to a cart, and finally check out,
               generating an order from the cart. The order is passed on to the sales or partner organization which owns the respective sales
               channel.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e24422">
            <p id="d12e24423">Order Processing and Fulfillment</p>
            <p id="d12e24425">Having received the order, the sales or partner organization fulfills the order. This may involve, among others, order status
               changes or line item status changes.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="con_order_mgmt">Global Order Management</h2>
      <p id="d12e24430">Commerce Management includes a manager to centrally manage orders from all channels which a sales or partner organization
         owns. Using global management, it is possible to view open and completed orders, manage the order status, or export orders.
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_order_search">Orders Search</h2>
      <p id="d12e24435">Orders can be searched by simple search (using order number, customer, customer type, channel, or order state to filter the
         result) or attribute-based parametric search (advanced search).
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_order_track">Order Tracking</h2>
      <p id="d12e24440">Orders can assume various order states which enable order managers to track which stages of the order handling process an
         order has already passed. Order states are modified upon importing order states, see <a href="con_order.html#con_order_impex">Order Export and Import</a>.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e24444">Various filters are available to track down orders depending on their state.</p>

         The configuration parameters for the services include the local file directory, which specifies the location of the exported
         files or, correspondingly, the location of the files to be imported, as well as logging and monitoring options. For details
         about enabling and configuring services, see <a href="task_pref_servMgmt.html#task_pref_servMgmt">Services Management</a>.

      <h2 id="con_order_ship">Shipping Configuration</h2>
      <p id="d12e24613">Intershop Commerce Management provides a simple, yet powerful interface to create shipping configurations that can combine
         shipping methods, freight classes and destination regions. For each channel, you can define an individual set of shipping
         configurations, which are then available in the corresponding channel storefront.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e24615">For shipping configurations, the following aspects are of importance:</p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e24617">
         <li id="d12e24618">
            <p id="d12e24619">Shipping Method</p>
            <p id="d12e24621">Shipping methods define the way of delivering purchased products to the buyer. In addition to shipping charges, which are
               added to the order subtotal, shipping time in days and a validity period,  Commerce Management operators can manage the display
               order for shipping methods in the storefront.

         <li id="d12e24623">
            <p id="d12e24624">Destination Regions</p>
            <p id="d12e24626">Commerce Management operators can define destination regions, which are then at the operator's disposal for setting up available
               shipping methods, shipping charges and shipping restrictions.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e24628">
            <p id="d12e24629">Freight Classes</p>
            <p id="d12e24631">Commerce Management operators can define freight classes and assign eligible shipping methods and destination regions. Freight
               classes are intended to be associated with products or catalog categories.

            <p id="d12e24634">Shipping Rules</p>
            <p id="d12e24636">Shipping rules provide a means to manage exceptions to the defined shipping configurations, for example, to restrict specific
               shipping methods to certain destination regions or to exclude individual products from being shipped to certain destination
               regions.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e24638">Some shipping rules apply to "shipping buckets", i.e., groups of product line items with the same shipping method and the
               same ship-to address.

      <h2 id="con_order_shipDate">Excluded Delivery Dates</h2>
      <p id="d12e24647">In Intershop Commerce Management based storefronts, customers can select a desired delivery date during the checkout process.
         Shop managers can restrict the available delivery dates, excluding, for example, public holidays.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e24649">To this end, shop managers can upload (one or more) lists of excluded delivery dates for given destination regions, see <a href="con_order.html#con_order_ship">Shipping Configuration</a>. Consequently, the system prevents a customer from selecting an excluded date as the desired delivery date and displays a
         corresponding error message.

      <h2 id="con_order_quote">Quoting</h2>
      <p id="d12e24665">In B2B scenarios, quoting constitutes a mechanism for business customers to manage pricing relations in the buying process.
         Quotes are mainly used for the following purposes:
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e24667">

         <li id="d12e24673">
            <p id="d12e24674">Reserve current price</p>
            <p id="d12e24676">Quotes are valid during a well-defined period. Therefore, quotes can be used to reserve a price for customers (for example,
               the current price or a negotiated price) during the validity period of the quote.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e24678">In the B2X edition of Intershop Commerce Management, the customer's users create quote requests in the storefront. They can
         edit, submit and delete quote requests. After the quotes have been responded by the merchant, the customer's users can add
         the quotes to their carts or reject the quotes. In the "My Account" section of the storefront, they can view and manage the
         list of their quote requests and quotes.
