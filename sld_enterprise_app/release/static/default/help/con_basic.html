      <p id="d12e1467">Intershop Commerce Management can be used by different types of organizations. Each type of organization participates in different
         business tasks and uses Intershop Commerce Management through a different set of business applications. Main actors working
         on Intershop Commerce Management include:
      </p>
      <h3 id="con_basic_actors_sales">Sales Organization</h3>
      <p id="d12e1472">The sales organization represents the owner or root organization of a system that implements a multi-channel sales business
         model. Typically, the sales organization represents an organization which manages its demand chain, publishes content and
         manages orders.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1474">Sales Organizations use Intershop Commerce Management to:</p>
      <ul class="disc" id="d12e1476">
         <li id="d12e1477">
            <p id="d12e1478">Manage the internal structure of the sales organization, such as departments, users, and roles.</p>

         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="con_basic_actors_ptn">Partners</h3>
      <p id="d12e1495">Partners represent selling organizations working within a partner channel. Hence, partners always have a superordinate or
         parent organization. The parent organization can be the sales organization, or another partner higher up in the demand chain.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1497">Partners use Intershop Commerce Management to:</p>

         </li>
      </ul>
      <h3 id="con_basic_actors_admin">Central Administrators</h3>
      <p id="d12e1539">Intershop Commerce Management includes a business application to perform central administration tasks, such as creating sales
         organizations, managing security settings, and initiating data replication processes.
      </p>
      <div class="note" id="d12e1541">
         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e1542">Central administrators are also responsible for managing central system resources, such as pipelines and templates, locales,
            system-wide settings for payment, tax and shipping methods. Many of these tasks are performed outside the business applications
            and require access to properties files and other system resources.
         </p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="con_basic_oma">Channels and Applications</h2>
      <h3 id="con_basic_oma_ch">Channels</h3>
      <p id="d12e1550">Sales and partner organizations set up channels to syndicate products to partners, to sell to customers, and to receive orders.</p>
      <p id="d12e1552">Intershop Commerce Management pre-defines certain channel types. The pre-defined channel types include:</p>
      <ul class="disc" id="d12e1554">
         <li id="d12e1555">
            <p id="d12e1556">partner channel</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e1558">
            <p id="d12e1559">sales channel</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e1561">The channel type defines</p>
      <ul class="disc" id="d12e1563">
         <li id="d12e1564">
            <p id="d12e1565">the business processes (including the front end applications) a partner or customer can use</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e1567">
            <p id="d12e1568">the administrative tools available to manage the sales channel.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e1570">For example, the sales channel provides the storefront (the front end application) that customers use to browse catalogs and
         create orders. In addition, the channel provides administrative tools (the channel management Commerce Management plug-in)
         used to manage the sales channel and the corresponding data, such as catalogs designed for customers or orders generated by
         customers.

      <h3 id="con_basic_oma_app">Applications</h3>
      <p id="d12e1587">Intershop Commerce Management can run multiple applications in the context of a channel or site. An application is a self-contained
         functional unit, based on an application type. Typically, each application type defines an individual set of functionality
         in order to support dedicated business processes (like for B2C or B2B) or serve dedicated front ends (for example, mobile
         devices).
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1589">The applications of one channel may share the channel data repositories or may use their own, application-specific data repositories.
         That is, an application can share, for example, the product data, user data and order data with the channel, but use its own
         content assets. The effective repository relations depend on the underlying application implementation.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1591">One application must be set as default, which means that it will be launched as the site's standard application if the URL
         does not include another application's URL identifier.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1593">Applications provide a "preview" mode. Originally a content management tool (see <a href="con_page.html#con_page_sfView">Storefront Design View</a>), the application preview constitutes a powerful means to immediately preview the effect of certain actions triggered in
         Commerce Management directly on the Web site, including promotion settings, price changes, etc.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1597">For details about applications, see <a href="con_apps.html#con_apps">Application Management: Concepts</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_basic_demChain">Demand Chains</h2>
      <p id="d12e1604">Based on the channel concept, the Intershop Commerce Management enables sales and partner organizations to create demand chains
         which are tailored precisely to their business needs.
      </p>
      <div class="figure" id="EnterpriseSalesChannels">
         <div class="figure_caption" id="d12e1607">Figure 3: Creating demand chains.</div><img src="icm_images/charts/ct_icm_enterpriseSalesCh.png" alt="Creating demand chains."></div>
      <p id="d12e1612">Besides channels, demand chains are based on two essential features: product syndication and sharing as well as order processing.</p>
      <h3 id="con_basic_dem_dstr">Product Syndication and Product Sharing</h3>
      <p id="d12e1617">Intershop Commerce Management provides two mechanisms for distributing products across channels: product sharing and product
         syndication.
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e1619">
         <li id="d12e1620">
            <p id="d12e1621">Product Sharing</p>
            <p id="d12e1623">With product sharing, sales or partner organizations can distribute large numbers of master products to sales channels. The
               products are not copied to the target channels but remain in the parent organization's master repository.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e1625">
            <p id="d12e1626">Product Syndication</p>
            <p id="d12e1628">With product syndication, sales channels can derive master products from parent sales or partner organizations. The master
               products are actually copied to the channel repositories.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e1630">Each organization can set up a master repository for products. Via product sharing or syndication processes, products can
         flow down the demand chain: from the master repositories to the channel repositories, then to the master and channel repositories
         of partner organizations, from there to the repositories of an indirect reseller, and so on.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1632">For more details about the two product distribution mechanisms, see <a href="con_cat.html#con_cat_shareSdc">Product Sharing vs. Product Syndication</a>.
      </p>
      <h3 id="con_basic_dem_order_proc">Order Processing</h3>
      <p id="d12e1639">Complementary to the product distribution processes, which distribute products down the demand chain, orders generated inside
         channels are forwarded (one level) up the demand chain. That is,
      </p>
      <ul class="disc" id="d12e1641">
         <li id="d12e1642">
            <p id="d12e1643">orders can be fulfilled directly in the channel,</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e1645">
            <p id="d12e1646">or orders (or individual order line items) can be processed by the sales organization that operates the channel.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e1648">Via the order export functionality, orders can be prepared for being processed by other organizations or external systems.</p>
