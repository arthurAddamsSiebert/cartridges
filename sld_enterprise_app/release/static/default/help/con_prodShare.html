      <p id="d12e4337">Intershop Commerce Management provides two mechanisms for distributing products across channels: product sharing and product
         syndication. For a general introduction, see <a href="con_cat.html#con_cat_shareSdc">Product Sharing vs. Product Syndication</a>.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e4341">This section introduces product sharing concepts.</p>
      <h2 id="con_prodShare_intro">Main Tasks</h2>
      <p id="d12e4346">With product sharing, sales or partner organizations can distribute large numbers of master products to sales channels ("outbound
         product sharing"). The products are not copied to the target channels but remain in the parent organization's master repository.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e4348">Generally, all deriving channels share the master data, regardless of their hierarchy. Channels can, however, choose to activate
         all or only a selected set of the shared master products ("inbound product sharing").
      </p>
      <p id="d12e4350">The following main tasks are involved in product sharing:</p>

            <p id="d12e4373">Channel Assignments</p>
            <p id="d12e4375">Sales or partner organizations select the channels with which they intend to share product data.</p>
            <div class="note" id="d12e4377">
               <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
               <p id="d12e4378">Sharing relations can only be established with channels that do not syndicate products from parent organizations.</p>
            </div>
            <p id="d12e4380">Generally, the assigned channels are intended to just reuse the original master product data. They can, however, still add
               new products or apply some channel-specific changes to master products (except for shared product variations, bundles and
               retail sets).
            </p>

            <p id="d12e4387">Product Data Assignments</p>
            <p id="d12e4389">For every sharing relation, i.e., for every assigned channel, the parent organization defines the scope of products to be
               shared. The available options are: nothing, all, or by sharing group.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e4391">For details about managing product data assignments, see <a href="task_pim_share.html#task_pim_share_assign">Managing Product Data Assignments</a> and <a href="task_pim_share.html#task_pim_share_grps_assign">Managing Sharing Group Product Assignments</a>.

            <p id="d12e4398">Sharing Groups</p>
            <p id="d12e4400">Sharing groups are a means to define reusable product sets intended to be shared. The available products are retrieved from
               the master repository via product selection rules or via simple or advanced search, with the result to be assigned completely
               or partially through selecting individual products. Using this mechanism, parent organizations can group, for example, products
               of a specific manufacturer or of a specific price range.
            </p>

            <p id="d12e4407">Manufacturer Aliases</p>
            <p id="d12e4409">With respect to product sharing, Intershop Commerce Management introduces "manufacturer aliases". Using aliases, organizations
               can specify new manufacturer names intended to represent one or more actual manufacturers. This eases the handling of multiple
               manufacturers that, based on their offering, could be grouped, or manufacturers that appear in more than one spelling, for
               example.

                  but only with their common alias name.
