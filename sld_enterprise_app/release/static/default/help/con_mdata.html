      <h2 id="con_mdata_label">Mass Data Operations Using Labels</h2>
      <p id="d12e30534">Labels provide a convenient means to group objects, in order to perform certain operations on these objects. Objects to which
         labels can be assigned include products, catalogs and categories as well as page variants, components and other content assets.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30536">Labels facilitate the execution of recurring operations, or operations that need to be applied to a large set of objects.
         For example, using labels you add or update custom attributes on objects, or export a set of objects.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30538">Note that using labels is similar to editing objects in batch mode, see <a href="con_mdata.html#con_mdata_batchProc">Batch Processes</a>. However, labels provide more flexibility, as they make it possible to group objects together that cannot be identified by
         a single search query. Moreover, label assignments are persistent, hence can be re-used as often as necessary.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30542">Working with labels involves the following tasks:</p>

            <p id="d12e30546">Defining labels</p>
            <p id="d12e30548">The first step is to create labels. A dedicated Label manager is available to create and manage labels, and to view all items
               which currently have this label assigned.

               use the Labels tab on the detail view of the respective object. For products, you can also perform a search and apply a label
               to all elements of the result set using a batch process.

      <h3 id="con_mdata_rep_whatis">What Is Data Replication?</h3>
      <p id="d12e30583">Data replication refers to the process of first updating data in a source system and then synchronizing the data with a target
         system. The data replication mechanism makes it possible to develop and maintain content in the background without disturbances
         to the live system.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30585">Data replication affects both database data (such as catalog, product, or user data) and file system data (such as images
         or product attachments).
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30587">Concurrent mass data operations and individually triggered "single-object" operations may produce inconsistent data. Intershop
         Commerce Management features a specific object-locking mechanism to prevent concurrent modifications of the same data. In
         case a user intends to edit an object that is already locked by another process, Commerce Management shows a warning and,
         depending on the operation, provides options to either

         <li id="d12e30593">
            <p id="d12e30594">wait a specified time and then fail, where the "calling" process waits the defined time for the previous lock to be released
               in order to run afterwards, or fails if the timeout is reached.

         <li id="d12e30596">
            <p id="d12e30597">fail, where the "calling" process is terminated immediately.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e30599">Data replication involves two main stages: defining data replication tasks and executing these tasks as data replication processes.
         Both stages are described in more detail below.
      </p>
      <h3 id="con_mdata_rep_tasks">Data Replication Tasks</h3>
      <p id="d12e30604">Data replication tasks determine the content to be replicated. They are defined by the responsible data replication managers
         individually for each channel in Commerce Management. For example, the data replication manager for the channel "inTRONICS"
         can define data replication tasks for this particular channel, using the sales channel management Commerce Management plug-in.

      <p id="d12e30606">For each data replication tasks, the data replication manager defines</p>

            <p id="d12e30617">To each replication task, one or more data replication groups are assigned. Data replication groups identify the content to
               be replicated. Each replication group refers to a certain content domain. For example, the data replication group "Organization"
               includes the organization profile, the departments, the users and roles, and all preferences defined for an organization.

      <h3 id="con_mdata_rep_proc">Data Replication Processes</h3>
      <p id="d12e30632">Once defined, data replication tasks are submitted to the Intershop Commerce Management system administrator for execution.
         To execute data replication tasks, the system administrator defines data replication processes in Organization Management.

            <p id="d12e30640">A source system can be connected to multiple target systems. However, each replication process can address a single target

            <p id="d12e30653">Data Replication Type</p>
            <p id="d12e30655">The data replication type determines whether a replication process involves only content transfer, content publication, or
               both. Additional replication types are available for special tasks or to undo a replication process involving content publication.

      <h2 id="con_mdata_sdc">Product Syndication</h2>
      <p id="d12e30660">Intershop Commerce Management provides two mechanisms for distributing products across channels: product sharing and product
         syndication. For a general introduction, see <a href="con_cat.html#con_cat_shareSdc">Product Sharing vs. Product Syndication</a>.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30664">With product syndication, sales channels can derive master products from parent sales or partner organizations. The master
         products are actually copied to the channel repositories. Copied (or derived) products are sometimes called also "offers".
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30666">Products are stored in product repositories.</p>

         <li id="d12e30669">
            <p id="d12e30670">Each sales or partner organization can set up a master product repository. From the master repositories, products can be derived
               into the available channel repositories.

         </li>
         <li id="d12e30672">
            <p id="d12e30673">Channel repositories are defined in the context of a channel. Each channel has a channel product repository. The channel repository
               contains the products to be made available to customers or partners.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e30675">Using master and channel repositories, products can flow down the demand chain: from the sales organization to customers and
         sales partners, from the sales partners to indirect resellers, and so on.

      <p id="d12e30677">Product syndication involves the following general workflow:</p>

            <p id="d12e30683">Product syndication requires the mapping of attributes (standard product attributes, catalog assignments, prices, etc.) of
               the original source product into attributes of a target product (offer). Attribute mapping is governed by product data mapping
               rules.

      <p id="d12e30710">The simplest mapping operation is to copy the value of a source product attribute into the same attribute of the target product.
         A more complex operation is to copy a source product attribute into a different attribute of the target product or, even more
         complex, to manipulate the attribute value before storing it into the target product, such as calculating a margin on a product
         price or translate the name of a product into another language.
