      <p id="d12e30284">Main tasks involved in partner and branding management include:</p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e30286">
         <li id="d12e30287">
            <p id="d12e30288">Manage Partner Accounts</p>
            <p id="d12e30290">Partners are associated with a general profile containing information such as general and address information.</p>

         <li id="d12e30292">
            <p id="d12e30293">Manage Branding</p>
            <p id="d12e30295">Branding refers to the possibility to customize the look and feel of Commerce Management individually for each partner. Branding
               is based on branding packages which need to be uploaded and installed.
            </p>
         </li>

            <p id="d12e30300">The payment methods available for your organization can be individually propagated, i.e., made available, for each partner
               channel.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30302">
            <p id="d12e30303">Manage Page and Component Sharing</p>
            <p id="d12e30305">Pages and components can be shared from a parent organization to a channel managed by the partner.</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="con_partn_profile">Partner Profile</h2>
      <p id="d12e30311">Partners represent selling organizations working within a partner channel. Hence, partners always have a superordinate or
         parent organization. The parent organization can be the sales organization, or another partner higher up in the demand chain.
         Partners are associated with a partner profile. The partner profile aggregates the following information:
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e30313">
         <li id="d12e30314">
            <p id="d12e30315">General Information</p>
            <p id="d12e30317">This includes information like the name of the user, the purchase currency, and the language used.</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30319">
            <p id="d12e30320">Contact Information</p>
            <p id="d12e30322">This refers to the contact address.</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30324">
            <p id="d12e30325">Application Branding</p>
            <p id="d12e30327">This setting defines the branding package which is used to customize Commerce Management for the partner. For details, see
               <a href="con_partn.html#con_partn_branding">Branding for Partners</a>.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="con_partn_branding">Branding for Partners</h2>
      <p id="d12e30334">Commerce Management can be customized individually for each partner. This kind of customization pertains to brand information,
         such as logos, colors and other settings responsible for the look and feel of Commerce Management for the partner.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30336">Branding is enabled by so-called branding packages. Branding packages are archives containing all resources necessary to customize
         the look-and-feel of Commerce Management, such as images and style sheets. Branding packages are first uploaded. To become
         effective, they then need to be installed relative to a locale. For each partner in a partner channel, multiple branding packages
         can be uploaded, but only one branding package can be installed per locale. On the other hand, it is possible to use one and
         the same branding package for different locales. 
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_partn_pay">Payment Methods for Partners</h2>
      <p id="d12e30341">Intershop Commerce Management provides out-of-the-box support for the following payment methods:</p>
      <ul class="disc" id="d12e30343">
         <li id="d12e30344">
            <p id="d12e30345">Cash on delivery</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30347">
            <p id="d12e30348">Direct debit transfer</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30350">
            <p id="d12e30351">Invoice</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30353">
            <p id="d12e30354">Cash in advance</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30356">
            <p id="d12e30357">Gift card</p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e30359">Additional payment methods can be provided through dedicated payment provider cartridges. The central system administrator
         makes the new payment methods available to your sales organization, which, in turn, has to propagate them to the partner channel
         and the corresponding partners.
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_partn_service">Services for Partners</h2>
      <p id="d12e30364">Intershop Commerce Management provides service interfaces for integrating third-party business services like Web analytics,
         mail, order, PIM or ERP solutions via dedicated service provider cartridges. Once a service provider cartridge is installed,
         the system administrator makes the new services available to the sales organizations using the central administration front
         end. Once propagated to the organization, the services are immediately available on all three hierarchy levels, i.e., within
         the organization, its dependent channels and their corresponding applications.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30366">In order to actually use a service, the system manager creates a "service configuration" on the organization or channel level,
         which represents a configurable association between a service type and the given level.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30368">When managing service configurations, the following characteristics are relevant:</p>
      <ul class="disc" id="d12e30370">
         <li id="d12e30371">
            <p id="d12e30372">You can create multiple (different) service configurations for one service type.</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30374">
            <p id="d12e30375">Service configurations can be shared with the dependent levels, applying several activation rules (shared and active, shared
               and inactive, shared and mandatory, unshared).
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e30377">
            <p id="d12e30378">In case a service configuration is shared, enabling or disabling it on the level on which it has been created directly affects
               the operability on all dependent levels.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e30380">Generally, this allows for implementing even complex scenarios. Think of individual search service configurations, for example,
         for multiple storefront applications in one channel. In this case, you would create multiple different service configurations
         of the same type in the channel and share them to all applications as inactive. For each application, you would then individually
         activate the one service configuration that is intended for the current application.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30382">For details about managing service configurations, see <a href="task_pref_servMgmt.html#task_pref_servMgmt">Services Management</a>.
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_partn_cont">Content Sharing for Partners</h2>
      <p id="d12e30389">Content assets, which are subject to storefront editing (pages, page variants, includes, components, page templates and component
         templates), can be shared across channels. With this respect, partner channels can "pass through" content assets from a parent
         sales or partner organization to a partner. The partner, in turn, shares pages and components to its sales channels.
