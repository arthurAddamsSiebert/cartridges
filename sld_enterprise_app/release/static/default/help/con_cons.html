      <h2 id="con_cons_types">Customer Types</h2>
      <p id="d12e27296">Customers represent the buyers or "contracting parties" of the sales (or partner) organization. Intershop Commerce Management
         distinguishes two customer types:
      </p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e27298">
         <li id="d12e27299">
            <p id="d12e27300">Individual customer</p>
            <p id="d12e27302">Indicates that the customer represents an individual buyer or a household in a B2C scenario. An individual customer is assigned
               exactly one user, which cannot be individually managed.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e27304">
            <p id="d12e27305">Business customer</p>
            <p id="d12e27307">Indicates that the customer represents a corporate buyer, i.e., a company or an organization, in a B2B scenario. A business
               customer can be assigned multiple users, which can be managed in Commerce Management.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e27309">Depending on the actual application setup, Intershop Commerce Management's features can differ according to the customer type.
         For example, it can display either gross prices or net prices, provide additional profile information, hide certain functionality,
         etc.
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_cons_profile">Customer Profile</h2>
      <p id="d12e27314">Upon registration, customers are associated with a customer profile. The customer profile aggregates the following types of
         information:

      <h2 id="con_cons_segm">Customer Segments</h2>
      <p id="d12e27374">Customers are part of customer segments. Customer segments aggregate subsets of customers according to well-defined criteria.
         For example, a customer segment could aggregate all customers who spend more than a certain amount of money per year.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e27376">Intershop Commerce Management enables customer segments based on customer segmentation services. This allows, for example,
         external systems to "push" customer segments into Intershop Commerce Management. Integrating customer segmentation services
         relies on Intershop Commerce Management's managed services interface, see <a href="con_serv.html#con_serv">Services</a>.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e27380">By default, Intershop Commerce Management incorporates a standard customer segmentation service that provides for assigning
         existing customer segments as target groups to various business objects like promotions, price lists, etc. Other custom or
         third-party customer segmentation services, which may add specific segmentation functionality and new segments, can be implemented
         on a project-specific base. In this case, you must create and manage individual service configurations for these services.
         If you enable multiple customer segmentation services, all customer segments provided by each of them are available as a combined
         result.
      </p>

         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e27383">Locally creating customer segments and managing associated customers does not depend on an enabled service. At least one working
            customer segmentation service, however, is required for assigning customer segments as target groups to other business objects.
         </p>

      <h2 id="con_cons_appr">Customer Approval</h2>
      <p id="d12e27458">In simple scenarios, a new customer can log in, browse the storefront and place orders immediately after registration. However,
         particularly in B2B scenarios and depending on the industry, the type of sold products or the shop guidelines, a merchant
         may want to approve new customers before they can actually use the storefront. To this end, Intershop Commerce Management
         facilitates an optional customer approval process.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e27460">With respect to customer approval, the following details are essential:</p>

      <p id="d12e27542">B2B scenarios usually require contract support. Contracts are purchasing agreements between merchants and business customers.
         Generally, they provide a frame for a defined set of catalogs and products, including corresponding price lists and promotions.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e27544">With respect to contracts, the B2X edition of Intershop Commerce Management by default allows for defining target revenues
         based on specific price lists. Basically, these price lists define special prices for certain products and thus, implicitly
         define the set of products included with the contract. In the storefront, the customers' users then benefit from the reduced
         prices according to their contract conditions.

      <p id="d12e27593">
         In compliance with the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ICM allows to handle Personal Data
         Requests. This includes the export as well as the deletion of personal data.
         There are two scenarios to create such data requests:

            <p id="d12e27597">Personal Data Request via Contact Form or Phone</p>
            <p id="d12e27599">An unregistered customer may either want to receive or delete personal data. Therefor the customer makes the respective request,
               e.g., by phone or via contact form. A customer service representative (CSR) then triggers the process for the respective customer
               with the status <span class="emphasis">pending</span> in the Commerce Management. The system sends a confirmation e-mail to the customer.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e27604">As soon as the e-mail's confirmation link is clicked, the system sets the request's status to <span class="emphasis">open</span>. Once the CSR starts to process the request, the status is set to <span class="emphasis">in progress</span>. The CSR then informs the customer about the progress of the request and sends e.g., a link to download the personal data
               or a notification about the deletion. Successfully processed requests are set to <span class="emphasis">closed (handled)</span>, rejected requests to <span class="emphasis">closed (rejected)</span>.
