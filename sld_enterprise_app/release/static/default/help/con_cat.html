      <h2 id="con_cat_types">Catalog Types</h2>
      <p id="d12e2781">Catalogs are distinguished along the following dimensions:</p>
      <ul class="square" id="d12e2783">
         <li id="d12e2784">
            <p id="d12e2785">Standard and Classification Catalogs</p>
            <p id="d12e2787">Standard catalogs use a freely-defined category structure to group products. Classification catalogs, on the other hand, pre-define
               the set of catalog categories to which products can be assigned. Apart from defining the set of available categories, they
               can also define classification attributes. Classification attributes are automatically associated with products assigned to
               a certain catalog category. Intershop Commerce Management provides out-of-the-box support for classification catalogs based
               on the eCl@ss and UN/SPSC standards. These catalogs are pre-loaded by the central administrator. They can be set online or
               offline by catalog managers of sales organizations. However, they cannot be deleted. In addition, catalog managers can define
               custom classification catalogs.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e2789">
            <p id="d12e2790">Shared and Local Catalogs</p>
            <p id="d12e2792">Catalogs can be shared or local. Shared catalogs are master catalogs which are shared to one or more channels. These catalogs
               can then be accessed by the business partners using that channel. Catalog sharing makes it possible to use pre-defined catalog
               structures across different channels.

         <li id="d12e2794">
            <p id="d12e2795">System Classification Catalogs</p>
            <p id="d12e2797">System classification catalogs are a means for creating and grouping products that have specific properties and therefore
               require a different handling. This may be the case with products like warranties, gift wraps, or downloads, which, for example,
               may be excluded from search indexes, may not require an inventory, etc.

            <p id="d12e2832">System classification catalogs are created with the database initialization only and cannot be edited via Commerce Management.
               Business managers can just assign products to the prepared system classification categories. The products then "inherit" all
               properties defined for the particular categories, becoming usable warranties, gift wraps, or downloads, for example.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="con_cat_classAttr">Classification Attributes</h2>
      <p id="d12e2837">For categories of custom classification catalogs, classification attributes can be defined in order to pre-define the attributes
         of the products assigned to a category. When assigning a product to a classification category with classification attributes
         defined, the attributes are offered to the product manager in a list. Note, however, that the product manager needs to set
         attribute values before the attributes are actually copied onto the product. If copied onto a product, the attributes become
         available via the Attributes tab which is part of the product detail view.
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_cat_features">Basic Product Features</h2>
      <p id="d12e2842">The following list summarizes basic product features:</p>

            <p id="d12e2851">Product Attributes</p>
            <p id="d12e2853">There are two attribute types: standard attributes and custom attributes. Standard attributes apply to all products. Custom
               attributes can be used to define attributes specific to a certain product. Product attributes can be localized. Localizable
               attributes define attribute values relative to a locale (or language).

               <p id="d12e2861">If, e.g., a product has no localized value for a custom attribute, the respective locale will not hold a search field for
                  this attribute. This means searching for an empty field (&lt;&lt;none&gt;&gt;) will not work in such case, since the field does not exist
                  at all. For details about search options, see <a href="ov_ui.html#ov_ui_searchOpt">General Search Options</a>.

               or not assigned to a catalog category. In addition, each product can be assigned to standard classification catalogs (such
               as eCl@ss or UN/SPSC) or custom classification catalogs.

               to each product for the buyers to view. Before attachments can be added, the respective content need to be uploaded into a
               content directory, which can then be browsed when defining attachments. For information on creating content directories and
               uploading static content, see <a href="con_cat.html#con_cat_impex">Catalog Import and Export</a>.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="con_cat_view">Catalog Views</h2>
      <p id="d12e2880">By default, all product catalogs defined or available within a channel are visible to all customers of this channel. Catalog
         views allow the channel catalog administrator to control the visibility of product catalog content on a customer-specific
         or customer segment-specific level. Using catalogs views makes it possible to personalize product catalogs depending on the
         individual needs of customers or customer segments, or even to hide entire product catalogs from selected customers or customer
         segments.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e2882">Setting up a catalog view involves the steps as shown in the following figure:</p>
      <div class="figure" id="concept_catview_b2c">
         <div class="figure_caption" id="d12e2885">Figure 14: Catalog Views: General Workflow</div><img src="icm_images/charts/ct_icm_catalogViews.png" alt="Catalog Views: General Workflow"></div>

         <li id="d12e2891">
            <p id="d12e2892">Include and Exclude Categories or Products</p>
            <p id="d12e2894">Defining a catalog view involves explicitly including or excluding product catalog categories or products. When starting catalog
               view definition, the catalog view excludes all categories by default. Your task then is to add all catalog categories that
               are to be included. To view only parts of a category branch, first include the main catalog category, then exclude the sub-categories
               or products that should be hidden.
            </p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e2896">
            <p id="d12e2897">Assign Customers/Customer Segments to View</p>
            <p id="d12e2899">Assign customers or a customer segment of the current channel to the catalog view. Once assigned, the view is effective for
               all members of the target group. Note that a single customer or customer segment can be assigned to multiple catalog views
               in parallel. If a customer or customer segment is not assigned to any view, there are no catalog visibility restrictions.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e2901">You can assign catalog views to customers or customer segments also when editing customer or customer segment details.</p>
         </li>
         <li id="d12e2903">
            <p id="d12e2904">Set View Online and Publish View</p>
            <p id="d12e2906">For a catalog view to be applied, it needs to be set online first. Later on, catalog views must be published whenever new
               categories are included or excluded or whenever the product repository is updated. It is possible to have catalog views published
               at regular intervals using a scheduled job to automate this process. The page cache is invalidated automatically as soon as
               a catalog view is set online or published.

         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e2909">In case catalog view definitions are in conflict, the settings for including categories take precedence over settings for
            excluding categories. For example, assume that a customer segment is assigned to two catalog views, A and B. Catalog view
            A includes the category "Monitors" while catalog view B excludes this category. In this case, the category in question will
            be visible to the customer segment assigned to these catalog views.

      <h2 id="con_cat_inbShare">Inbound Product Sharing</h2>
      <p id="d12e2914">With product sharing, sales or partner organizations can distribute large numbers of master products to sales channels ("outbound
         product sharing"). The products are not copied to the target channels but remain in the parent organization's master repository.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e2916">Generally, all deriving channels share the master data, regardless of their hierarchy. Channels can, however, choose to activate
         all or only a selected set of the shared master products ("inbound product sharing").

      <h2 id="con_cat_prodFlt">Predefined Product Filters</h2>
      <p id="d12e2925">With an integrated third-party search engine (see <a href="con_serv.html#con_serv_search">Search Index Services</a>), Intershop Commerce Management features flexible product filtering options. Catalog managers can predefine product filters.
         Predefined product filters are then available for dynamically assigning products to catalog categories, or for automatically
         populating page components with products, intended to be displayed, for example, as category page "end caps".

      <p id="d12e2929">Predefined product filters apply either directly to a catalog/category (see <a href="task_pim_cat.html#task_pim_cat_flt">Assigning Products Using Filters</a>) or through assigning specific, product filter-aware pages, see <a href="task_pim_cat.html#task_pim_cat_contView">Managing Category Content Views</a>.

            <p id="d12e3299">When defining the attributes that should belong to an attribute group, you provide an attribute name and an ID. The attribute
               name is used for display purposes. The ID is matched by the system against standard and product attributes in order to retrieve
               the respective attribute value. If the attribute values are localized as well, the value for the respective locale is retrieved.
               For example, if the current locale of a user is German (de_DE), the system retrieves the attribute name for German as defined
               in the attribute group, and the attribute value for German as defined on the product to be displayed.

               distinguish between various image sizes (e.g., zoom, standard, thumbnail), quality scales (e.g., low, medium, high_externally_hosted)
               or MIME types (e.g., gif, png, tiff).
            </p>
            <p id="d12e3326">In addition to the primary image view (or predefined image sets, if any), catalog managers can associate extra image view/type

      <p id="d12e3340">Intershop Commerce Management features powerful, yet flexible mechanisms to define product prices, including list prices,
         cost prices, and price lists containing customer-specific scaled prices.
      </p>
      <h3 id="con_cat_prices_list">List Price and Cost Price</h3>
      <p id="d12e3345">Each product has a list price. The list price is a simple, fixed price independent from the ordered product quantity. A list
         price can be defined separately for each currency available on the system. The list price serves as main reference for calculating
         other product prices, such as scaled prices within price lists.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e3347">Optionally, a cost price can be defined for a product, again separately for each available currency on the system. Sales and
         partner organizations can use this price to represent the cost which arises when procuring the product from a supplier or
         parent organization. Using the cost price as a basis, various scenarios are possible in which the list price of a product
         is derived from its cost price by adding a fixed or percentage surcharge, or by granting a discount. For example, the list
         price of a product could be the cost price plus 10% on top, representing the desired margin.

      <p id="d12e3355">List price and cost price can be managed in two different ways: using the Pricing tab of the product detail view, or using
         the Price List manager.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e3357">Two price lists are available by default: the Standard Price List, which lists all products along with their defined list
         price, and the Cost Price List, which lists all  products for which cost prices have been defined. These lists provide direct
         access to product prices, facilitating the management of list and cost prices for products.

      <h3 id="con_cat_prices_mapping">Mapping List and Cost Prices in Syndication</h3>
      <p id="d12e3371">When deriving products via syndication, various options are available for mapping and re-calculating list and cost prices.
         Which options are available depends on whether the syndication process involves repositories belonging to different organizations
         (e.g., when syndicating from a channel repository of organization X to the master repository of a partner organization Y),
         or whether syndication involves repositories belonging to the same organization (i.e., when syndicating from the master repository
         to a channel repository).
      </p>
      <p id="d12e3373">The mapping rules below are available in case products are syndicated from a repository that belongs to a different organization.
         For example, the rules are available if the sales organization syndicates products from a supplier into its master repository,
         or if a partner organization syndicates products from its parent organization.

      <p id="d12e3412">In addition to list prices, channel administrators can define special price lists for channel products.</p>
      <p id="d12e3414">Special price lists are used for the following main purposes:</p>

            <p id="d12e3418">Define Scaled Prices</p>
            <p id="d12e3420">The prices contained in price lists are expressed as scaled prices. A scaled price can vary depending on the order quantity.
               The scaled price can be expressed as fixed price (e.g., 12,99 USD) or as percentage discount (e.g., 10 %). For each active
               currency, a separate scaled price for each ordered quantity can be defined.

         <li id="d12e3422">
            <p id="d12e3423">Define Customer-Specific Prices</p>
            <p id="d12e3425">Price lists can be used to define special prices targeted at specific customers or customer segments. As part of setting up
               price lists, you can define to which target group, i.e., customers or customer segments, the price list applies. Hence, the
               prices that a price list defines are valid only for those users that are member of the target group assigned to the price
               list.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e3427">You can assign price lists to customers or customer segments also when editing customer or customer segment details.</p>

            <p id="d12e3430">Define Time-Limited Prices</p>
            <p id="d12e3432">For each price list, channel administrators can define a valid-from and valid-to date. Hence, price lists can be used to define
               special prices valid during a limited period of time.
            </p>
         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e3434">For example, the sample product below defines two different prices for the price lists "Best-Price Offerings" and "Christmas
         Thank-You Promotion". The price defined for price list "Christmas Thank-You Promotion" is customer-specific, as this price
         list is available to member of customer segment "Premium Customers" only.

      </p>
      <p id="d12e3444">Note that if a user is part of multiple customer segments, situations may arise in which more than one price could be offered

               to the "Custom Lookup" strategy, the system checks all available price lists top-down, starting with the price list ranked
               highest, until a price could be determined.

         </li>
         <li id="d12e3450">
            <p id="d12e3451">According to the "Best Price" strategy, the system will select the best price from all price lists which can be applied to

      <p id="d12e3781">Variation master and variation products are standard products in the sense that each of them can have standard and custom
         attributes, prices, attachments, etc. Note also that the attribute values of the variation master and the attributes of the
         variation products are not related to each other.

         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e3794">Product variations can be defined with reference to existing products in a repository by first defining the variation model
         on the product that acts as variation master, and then selecting the variation products from the repository. It is also possible
         to have the variation products created automatically, based on product variation types. A product variation type pre-defines
         a variation attribute and possible attribute values. When creating variation products based on a variation type, a new variation
         product is created for each resulting attribute-value pair in the variation type. For example, when defining a variation type
         with an attribute "Processor Speed" that has two possible values (say, "3 GHz" and "3.4 GHz"), two variation products will
         be created.

      </ul>
      <p id="d12e3808">It is also possible to automatically create variation products based on more than one variation type at the same time. For

      <p id="d12e3828">A product bundle represents a group of products that is offered to customers with an own SKU and an overall price. The bundle
         is typically designed to be ordered as a whole and presented in the storefront as a single item. The products that are part
         of the bundle (referred to as bundled products) can be product bundles themselves. Product bundles can be imported and exported
         like standard products.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e3830">A retail set is similar to a product bundle. A retail set combines products to be presented together on the same storefront
         page, as a group of products. Typically, all products can be added to the basket with a single click. Unlike product bundles,
         however, retail sets do not have an overall price. Hence, when ordering all products belonging to a retail set, the overall
         price is calculated from the prices of the individual retail set products. The products that are part of a retail set can
         be retail sets themselves. Retail sets can be imported or exported like standard products.

      <h2 id="con_cat_links">Category Links and Product Links</h2>
      <p id="d12e3835">Catalog managers can define static links between products and/or catalog categories in order to define relations between products
         and categories. The following link relations are possible:

         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e3850">When working with catalog categories or products, catalog managers can define both "outbound" links and "inbound" links. Outbound
         links define another product or category as the "relation target", whereas inbound links make the current category the "relation
         target" of another product or category.

         <div class="adm-type">Caution:</div>
         <p id="d12e4119">Product sharing and product syndication cannot be used in parallel in the same channel. If sharing is enabled for a channel,
            products cannot be syndicated to this channel. If, in turn, products are syndicated to a channel, products cannot be shared
            with this channel.

            <p id="d12e4125">With product sharing, sales or partner organizations can distribute large numbers of master products to sales channels ("outbound
               product sharing"). The products are not copied to the target channels but remain in the parent organization's master repository.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e4127">Generally, all deriving channels share the master data, regardless of their hierarchy. Channels can, however, choose to activate
               all or only a selected set of the shared master products ("inbound product sharing").
            </p>
            <p id="d12e4129">Channels that share master products can still add new products or change attributes of a master product by overriding the
               entire product. When changing a master product attribute, a new channel product is created with a reference to the master
               product (which serves as a look-up fallback). Note, however, that shared product variations, bundles and retail sets cannot
               be modified. For details, see <a href="con_prodShare.html#con_prodShare">Product Sharing Management: Concepts</a>.

            </p>
            <p id="d12e4141">Product syndication requires the mapping of attributes (standard product attributes, catalog assignments, prices, etc.) of
               the original source product into attributes of a target product (offer). Specific rules control how attributes of the original
               (source) product are mapped into attributes of the target product. Upon syndicating, hence, attributes can be changed. For

               by Intershop Commerce Management, they do not manage these IDs within the Intershop Commerce Management database themselves.
               However, these identifiers are important whenever hosted suppliers or sellers need to interact with their manufacturers, for
               example to fulfill orders.

            <p id="d12e4273">Supplier ID</p>
            <p id="d12e4275">This product identifier is defined and maintained by the supplier of a product. Suppliers usually aggregate products from
               different manufacturers and therefore need their own numbering schema to uniquely identify products from different manufacturers.

            <p id="d12e4280">This product identifier is defined and maintained by the actual seller of a product. Seller IDs are defined relative to a
               product identifier scope. This makes it possible to assign multiple seller IDs in case the seller offers the product in multiple
               repositories.

         </li>
      </ul>
      <p id="d12e4287">PIDs are defined as custom attributes. Each PID definition comprises two parts: one part to define the owner of the PID (buyer,
         seller, supplier, or manufacturer), the other part to define the actual value. A sample definition of a Supplier ID is shown
         below:

					</pre><p id="d12e4291">In many cases, PID definitions are more complex. Consider the sample below. The sample defines three different PIDs (SellerID,
         SupplierID, ManufacturerID). Note that the Seller ID has a well-defined scope (the domain "inSPIRED-MasterRepository") to
         identify the repository relative to which the Seller ID has been defined.
