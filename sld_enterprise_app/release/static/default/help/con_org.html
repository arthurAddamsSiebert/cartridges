      <h2 id="con_org_intro">Introduction</h2>
      <p id="d12e29811">Intershop Commerce Management enables you to build a department structure which reflects the internal structure of your organization.
         Users are related to departments via the assignment of roles. These roles define tasks users can perform, and they ultimately
         also determine the functional parts of the application which users can access or see when logging in to Commerce Management.
      </p>
      <h2 id="con_org_wflow">Main Tasks</h2>
      <p id="d12e29816">Main tasks involved in organization management include:</p>

      <h2 id="con_org_dep">Departments</h2>

            <p id="d12e29900">Roles</p>
            <p id="d12e29902">Each department has a set of roles. These roles determine which activities department users can perform. The pool of roles
               available to a department comprises all master roles of an organization, but can also comprise custom roles available to this
               department only. For details, see <a href="con_org.html#con_org_acc">Access Privileges and Roles</a>.

         contexts.

            <p id="d12e29925">Users are assigned to one or more departments via the assignment of department roles. The roles determine what a user can
               do, for example, managing catalogs, orders, or users. When assigning a department role to a user, you first select the department
               to which the user should belong, and then choose from the roles that the department has defined. For details, see <a href="con_org.html#con_org_acc_dep">Department Roles</a>.

            <p id="d12e29932">Roles determine the access privileges of a user. Hence, when being assigned a role, a user indirectly receives all the access
               privileges which the role comprises. In addition, access privileges can be assigned to a user directly. For details, see <a href="con_org.html#con_org_acc_priv">Access Privileges</a>.

      <h2 id="con_org_acc">Access Privileges and Roles</h2>
      <p id="d12e29947">Tasks which users are allowed to perform in the interface are controlled by roles. Roles are composed of one or more access
         privileges.
      </p>
      <h3 id="con_org_acc_priv">Access Privileges</h3>
      <p id="d12e29952">Access privileges control which portions of the system are accessible to the user. For example, the access privilege <span class="emphasis">Catalog Manager</span> enables users to access all functional blocks of the application that are related to catalog management, such as the <span class="emphasis">Products</span> manager inside the <span class="emphasis">Catalog</span> section. Users assigned to a role comprising only this access privilege will see this portion of the interface only. Other
         portions of the interface (such as all channel-related links) are hidden.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e29963">Access privileges are pre-defined in the system. Further access privileges can be defined during implementation. Access privileges
