      <h2 id="con_apps_whatis">What Is an Application?</h2>
      <p id="d12e30220">Intershop Commerce Management can run multiple applications in the context of a channel or site. An application is a self-contained
         functional unit, based on an application type. Typically, each application type defines an individual set of functionality
         in order to support dedicated business processes (like for B2C or B2B) or serve dedicated front ends (for example, mobile
         devices).
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30222">The applications of one channel may share the channel data repositories or may use their own, application-specific data repositories.
         That is, an application can share, for example, the product data, user data and order data with the channel, but use its own
         content assets. The effective repository relations depend on the underlying application implementation.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30224">One application must be set as default, which means that it will be launched as the site's standard application if the URL
         does not include another application's URL identifier.

      <h2 id="con_apps_tasks">Main Tasks</h2>
      <p id="d12e30229">Main tasks involved in application management include:</p>

            <p id="d12e30233">Managing Applications</p>
            <p id="d12e30235">Managing applications involves creating, enabling and deleting applications as well as setting the default application.</p>

            <p id="d12e30238">Managing Application Branding</p>
            <p id="d12e30240">Branding refers to the possibility to customize the look and feel of the storefront application. Branding is based on branding
               packages which need to be uploaded and installed.

               directly on the Web site.

      <h2 id="con_apps_brand">Application Branding</h2>
      <p id="d12e30259">The sales channel storefront can be customized individually for each sales channel storefront application. This kind of customization
         pertains to brand information, such as logos, colors and other settings responsible for the look and feel of the storefront.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e30261">Branding is enabled by so-called branding packages. Branding packages are archives containing all resources necessary to customize
         the look-and-feel of the storefront application, such as images and style sheets. Branding packages are first uploaded. To
         become effective, they then need to be installed relative to a locale. For each storefront application, multiple branding
         packages can be uploaded, but only one branding package can be installed per locale. On the other hand, it is possible to
         use one and the same branding package for different locales.

      <h2 id="con_apps_preview">Application Preview</h2>
      <p id="d12e30270">Applications provide a "preview" mode. Originally a content management tool (see <a href="con_page.html#con_page_sfView">Storefront Design View</a>), the application preview constitutes a powerful means to immediately preview the effect of certain actions triggered in
         Commerce Management directly on the Web site, including promotion settings, price changes, etc.

      <p id="d12e30274">For details about using the application preview mode, see <a href="task_page_sf.html#task_page_sf_launch">Launching Design View</a>.
