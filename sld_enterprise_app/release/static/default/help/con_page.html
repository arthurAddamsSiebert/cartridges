      <p id="d12e12630">Intershop Commerce Management provides a powerful and intuitive authoring mechanism that allows catalog managers and content
         managers to easily edit and manage storefront pages.
      </p>
      <p id="d12e12632">The content management is based on a set of application type-specific models and their implementations. Generally, they enable
         developers to model "pagelets", i.e., the page and component building blocks, for a storefront application, and users to create
         and edit the corresponding page and component instances in Commerce Management.

            <p id="d12e12647">A page can be conceived of as an "entry point" to the storefront, whereas a page variant constitutes the "container" object
               that holds the actual content. Pages must have assigned at least one and can have assigned multiple page variants. Individual
               page variants can be subject to personalization, time control, etc.
            </p>

               page. The types cannot be changed once the pages or page variants are created.
            </p>
            <p id="d12e12670">Depending on the type, each page or page variant may require a specific set of configuration parameters, e.g., links to categories,
