<!--Acts as a manual fallback opportunity to track and assign an affiliate program or partner to the user.

This should not be necessary, if the DefaultPageStructure\-template have had got the WA Include to AffiliateInclude\-UpdateCount.
\- If you don't have such an Include, the users have to use this Pipeline when they are coming from an affiliate, but watch out for the Page Cache!
\- Be aware that the affiliate determination is included in the Prefix\-Start Pipeline by default and is called implicitly. (again, watrch the Page cache!)
\- If you don't have the Affiliate handling in your Prefix Pipeline, you have to add it in here by customization.
