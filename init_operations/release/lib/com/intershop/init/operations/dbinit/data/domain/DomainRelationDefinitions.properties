#
# Definition of the relation definitions created during dbinit.
# The name attribute is used for uniquely identifying a relation definition. In contrast to the displayName attribute, it's not localized.
# The cardinality attribute indicates the cardinality of a relation. The following values are possible:
# 1:1
# 1:n
# n:1
# m:n
# The pattern x:y used above means: x source domains are in a relation with y target domains.
# The sourceRoleName attribute is e.g. used for an intuitive naming used for looking up (the) source domain(s) of a relation.
# The targetRoleName attribute is used analogously.
# Display name and descriptions are defined on the appropriate localized property file.
#
# Syntax: name=cardinalities
#             ...
# Example: SHIPPING_METHOD=1:n
#

SITE=m:n
SLD_EXTERNAL_SYSTEM=1:n
