      <p id="d12e1484">The File Browser enables Intershop Commerce Management directory browsing and zip-compressed download from System Management.
         This tool enables administrators to quickly browse the Intershop Commerce Management directories without requiring access
         to the file system as only the System Management login is required. With this tool, it is possible to view and download files
         from any server within an Intershop Commerce Management cluster.

      <p id="d12e1492">By default, all directories are hidden. System folders are made available by configuring the property file located at <span class="emphasis">&lt;IS_SHARE&gt;/system/config/apps/intershop.enfinity.SMC/filebrowser.properties</span>. Here you can specify directories and sub directories for viewing and download by using the IS path alias (such as <span class="emphasis">${IS_SHARE};${IS_HOME}</span>) or without the alias (such as <span class="emphasis">c:/share/****</span> or <span class="emphasis">/var/***</span>) depending on your operating system. To set a directory to 'browsable'(viewable), edit the property file per the following:
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1506"><span class="code">filebrowser.dir.browsable=${IS_SHARE}/system/log;${IS_HOME}/webadapter/log;/var/log</span></p>
      <div class="note" id="d12e1509">
         <div class="adm-type">Note:</div>
         <p id="d12e1510">All sub directories within a 'browsable' directory are automatically viewable.</p>
      </div>
      <p id="d12e1512">The above example sets three log directories as viewable by the file browser. These are separated by a semi-colon (;).</p>
      <p id="d12e1514">Conversely you can specify a set of files or sub directories as hidden with a regular expression even if the directory is
         viewable. To hide a file within the above defined directories, edit the property file per the following:
      </p>
      <p id="d12e1516"><span class="code">filebrowser.files.hidden.regexp=.*zip</span></p>
      <p id="d12e1519">The above example hides all files that end with 'zip' from being able to be viewed in the file browser.</p>
