FormParameter.ApplicationRecentlyViewedItemsPreference.ItemsLifetime.description=Possible values from 1 to 20000 (both inclusive). A life time greater than 24447 would result in an integer overflow, because it will be multiplied with the time unit, which can be 87840.\n\nLifetime parameter is of type Object, because if the expiration type is NOT "Time" it doesn't matter. If it is "Time",\nthen the validator will deal with the type.
